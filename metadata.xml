Several of the plates spread over two pages in this book. Those plates have been recombined, however, a vertical stroke of these images in the gutter could not be scanned, and is thus left white. These plates appear to have been redrawn for this English edition, and differ in numerous details from the illustrations in 17th century editions.
Scans are available from the Internet Archive (copy 1), as wel as scans of the first edition (copy 1, 2).
Scans of the original English 1609 edition are also available on the Internet Archive. Further editions in the orginal Dutch and various translations can also be found there.
