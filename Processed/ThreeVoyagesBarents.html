<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Introduction to the second edition of this volume was already printed when the
Arctic exploring ships, H.M.S. <i>Alert</i> and <i>Discovery</i>, returned to England, and I avail myself of this opportunity to express the feelings
of admiration which the undaunted courage and perseverance displayed by its gallant
crews have given rise to abroad; and to repeat, with warm enthusiasm, that “welcome-home”
which is still finding expression over the whole civilised world.
</p>
<p>The year 1876 will undoubtedly be written with golden letters in the annals of English
Arctic exploring, for not only the north, but also the north-east, was the scene of
English enterprise.
</p>
<p>At the same time that Captain Nares and Captain Stephenson, under the most trying
circumstances, succeeded in pushing the Government ships through the heavy barriers
of ice which obstructed the outlet of Smith’s Sound, another Englishman, Mr. Charles
Gardiner, boldly penetrated the Kara Sea. Mr. Gardiner visited Barendsz Yshaven, and
brought home from thence a valuable collection of highly interesting relics.
</p>
<p>The following is a short account of this very successful cruise.
</p>
<p>The yacht <i>Glow-worm</i> left Hammerfest (Norway) on June 23rd, and made her first ice on the 4th of July,
being about twenty-five miles to westward of Goose Land (Novaya Zemlya). The approach
to the land was found to be obstructed by solid icefields, but two days afterwards,
Mr. Gardiner succeeded in reaching the land-water, and shaping his course north, he
tried to get as far as Cape Nassau.
</p>
<p>A continuance of westerly winds having blocked up the west coast entirely, Mr. Gardiner,
a few miles north of Matotschkin Schar, was stopped by an impenetrable barrier of
ice, which, closing upon the land, stretched itself far away to the westward. Finding
the ice barrier which obstructed the entrance of Matotschkin Schar only two miles
broad, Mr. Gardiner, under steam and canvas, forced his way through, and on the 20th
reached the open water in the Straits. To his great surprise he found the Straits
perfectly clear of ice, which, so early in the season, was a very unusual fact.
</p>
<p>July 25th, his yacht reached the land-water along the east coast, and shaping her
course for White Island, Mr. Gardiner boldly penetrated into the Kara Sea. Having
got about thirty miles in that direction, his ship was brought up by a heavy solid
pack, which stretched away to the eastward as far as could be seen. Judging that the
westerly winds would have cleared the east coast of Novaya Zemlya, Mr. Gardiner steered
north, with the intention of trying, if possible, to reach Barendsz Yshaven.
</p>
<p>The weather now became most trying. Continual fogs, numerous icebergs, and, at intervals, ice all round, made the navigation in
these almost unknown waters very dangerous. The little ship for many days had to grope
her way along the coast like a blind man, but Mr. Gardiner, never yielding to all
these dangers and obstacles, had the well-earned satisfaction of entering Yshaven
at eight o’clock in the morning of the 29th of July. Finding the bay still filled
up with fast ice, he anchored outside of it.
</p>
<p>Amidst fogs and snow-drift he, during three days, made the most careful researches
on and about the spot. He found the ruins of the Old House fallen completely into
decay; but, leaving nothing untouched, and grubbing in every nook and corner, he gathered
from under the ice a most splendid and highly interesting collection of more than
a hundred different articles. Depositing a record of his having been there, Mr. Gardiner,
on August 2nd, shaped his course for White Island.
</p>
<p>In vain he attempted to make more easting. About thirty miles distance from the land
his yacht was always stopped by impenetrable ice. This forced him to go south in the
land-water, and on the 13th he arrived at Waygatz Island. In order to cross over to
the Yalmal Peninsula, he had to push his way through very heavy ice; and while coasting
north, along the low Siberian coast, a heavy pack was always in sight on his portbeam.
On August 18th, very thick weather obliged him to drop his anchor. It blew a gale
from the north-west, which, bringing the pack down on the land, threatened to force
the yacht ashore. The position was very dangerous indeed, and steam was ordered to be kept up
ready at a moment’s notice.
</p>
<p>Not long after, a very large floe, some 1,000 yards in circumference, drifted down
on the little ship, and the pressure was such that the cable with fifty fathoms parted.
In a few minutes, the yacht drew only eight feet of water under her keel. Mr. Gardiner,
however, not only succeeded in saving his ship, but next day got his lost anchor again;
on which he boldly pushed further north. Three days afterwards, in 67 deg. 10 min.
east longitude and 72 deg. 20 min. north latitude, he experienced very bad weather.
A strong north-east gale, it being very thick, brought so much ice down that the ship
could not hold her ground. This weather continuing, and it being rather late in the
season, orders were given to return.
</p>
<p>Passing Pet Straits on the 23rd, the yacht was back in Hammerfest on the 28th of August,
after a most successful and interesting cruise, the history of which adds another
bright page to the glorious annals of English enterprise.
</p>
<p>The collection of the Barendsz relics, which were brought over to England, consisted
of more than a hundred different objects. Remains of carpenters’ tools, broken parts
of old weapons, and sailors’ materials, form the greater part of the collection. Among
the most curious articles are a wooden stamp with seal, a leaden inkstand, two goose
feather writing pens, a small iron pair of compasses, a little cubic die-stone, a
heavy harpoon with ring, besides twenty well-preserved wax candles, very likely the oldest in the world now existing. Besides
these, there are three Dutch books, two Dutch coins, an old Amsterdam ell-measure,
together with the ship’s flag of Amsterdam, having been the first European colour
which passed a winter in the Arctic Regions.
</p>
<p>The authenticity of the Barendsz relics is now fully borne out, for in one of the
powder-horns was found the well-known manuscript which Barendsz left behind, hung
up in the chimney. Though much decayed, it is with the exception of a few words perfectly
legible. It is not, as some have supposed it to be, a kind of journal, but merely
a short record, giving the principal facts we knew already from De Veer’s accounts.
The dates it gives, perfectly agree with the aforesaid accounts, whilst the record
is signed by Heemskerck and William Barendsz. The signature of Heemskerck is identified,
but that of William Barendsz was, till now, unknown.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner, knowing that the relics brought home by Captain Carlsen in 1871, were
bought by the Netherlandish Government, and convinced of the great interest which
they possess for the native land of the great explorer, has most generously offered
this collection to the Dutch nation. When this fact becomes known by the general public
in Holland, we feel sure every true Netherlander will be very thankful to Mr. Charles
Gardiner for this generous and courteous act.

<p>LIEUT<sup>T.</sup> KOOLEMANS BEYNEN, R.N.N.
</p>
<p>The re-publication by the Hakluyt Society of the first true polar voyage ever made,
is very opportune, now that the people of England have revived their interest in maritime
enterprise and are waiting with anxiety the results of the Government expedition up
Smith’s Sound, where the brave explorers in the <i>Alert</i> and <i>Discovery</i> are enduring the hardships of an Arctic winter. A deep interest in this expedition,
manifested in various ways, is felt throughout the whole civilised world, and never
did ships sail to the Arctic Regions which were followed with greater sympathy or
warmer wishes both at home and abroad. While we are waiting with increasing impatience
for the first news of their proceedings, the voyages of the stout-hearted Dutch pioneers
of Arctic exploration will be found exceedingly interesting, showing what the human
constitution can endure under good leadership, and stimulated and controlled by <span class="pageNum" id="pbii">[<a href="#pbii">ii</a>]</span>faith and discipline. They have set an example to all other Arctic navigators, by
showing the necessity for being well prepared to sustain a winter in the polar pack.
If future explorers should find themselves surprised amidst the ice, and consequently
be obliged to winter, let them bear their hardships as those Dutchmen did, under the
command of Heemskerck and the leadership of William Barendsz.
</p>
<p>The narrative of the three voyages undertaken by the Dutch, towards the close of the
sixteenth century, with a view to the discovery of a north-east passage to China,
was printed for the Hakluyt Society in 1853. Then the learned Dr. Beke, the eminent
traveller and geographer, wrote the introduction. But since that time Novaya Zemlya
has been circumnavigated, the house in which Barendsz and his gallant companions wintered
has been found, whilst its true position and those of many other points along the
coast have been accurately determined. Moreover, the researches into the Archives
and old State papers of the Netherlands have thrown much new light on the proceedings
of the early Dutch Arctic explorers, and on the circumstances under which these voyages
were undertaken.
</p>
<p>For these reasons, it has been thought advisable, in this second edition, to lay before
the members of the Society the results of subsequent research.
</p>
<p>It will not be necessary to recall to mind the condition of the Netherlands at the
close of the sixteenth century, now that the fascinating work of Motley, <span class="pageNum" id="pbiii">[<a href="#pbiii">iii</a>]</span>on the <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>, is familiar to every one. The heroic Dutchmen, assisted by their not less gallant
English friends, had to fight against superior forces, composed of the best soldiers
and led by the ablest generals of Philip of Spain. Disposing of resources such as
no other prince of the period possessed, backed by the most renowned captains of the
age, and aided by the religious fanaticism of his subjects, Philip was nevertheless
unable to maintain his hold over the United Provinces, which sought to render their
land independent of Spain, as they had formerly freed it from the sea. This land had
been reclaimed by their fathers in ever recurring struggles, not only with the ocean,
but likewise with the rivers Rhine, Maas, and Scheldt, which discharge their ice and
waters into the North Sea. Their descendants still continue fighting against heavy
odds to keep their land and property above water, notwithstanding the progress made
in engineering and hydraulics. As an old ship at sea is kept afloat by continual pumping,
caulking, and repairing, so, too, are the Low Countries preserved from destruction.
This constant labour and enormous expense may be rendered useless at any moment by
a sudden rise in the rivers, an equinoctial storm from the ocean, the breaking up
of the ice, or the melting of the snow on distant mountains; so that, notwithstanding
the indefatigable industry of the people, the bulwarks may be destroyed behind which
they are never safe. In such a school were the old Dutchmen trained. They knew by
sad experience <span class="pageNum" id="pbiv">[<a href="#pbiv">iv</a>]</span>that their country could only be held by hard fighting with the sea, and it was also
by hard fighting that they were enabled to gain their political independence, and
the liberty to worship God as they pleased. But the war against Philip was very expensive,
and laid a heavy charge upon the already over-burdened shoulders of the people. Agriculture
and dairy farming could scarcely supply the means to cover the indispensable outlay
necessary for keeping their land above water. Already, in a petition for the remission
of taxes, addressed by the States of Holland to the Emperor Charles V, we read as
follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“That Holland is very small, both in length and breadth, almost with three sides exposed
to the sea, and full of downs, swamps, turf-moors, lakes, and other unfruitful places,
where one can neither sow corn nor graze cattle; wherefore the inhabitants, to find
food for their wives and children, are obliged to go and trade and traffic in foreign
ports, and to export certain tissues, for which reasons the principal profession of
the country is the art of navigation and the sea trade.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Thus from the earliest times they had looked upon navigation and commerce as the great
source of their wealth, and from this source they expected to get the means to carry
on the war. It may be true that they worshipped the “almighty dollar”, but not for
itself, not only from a hope of gain, but also from the purest patriotism, because
they could not continue their struggle for independence without money, and this could
only be gained by giving more expansion to commerce, and not despising small advantages.
Hence their natural resolution to search in every <span class="pageNum" id="pbv">[<a href="#pbv">v</a>]</span>direction for new trade routes, and to risk so many lives and ships on their desperate
exploring expeditions in frozen latitudes, hoping to reach Cathay and the Spice Islands
by going north-about. In that direction they expected to avoid the superior Spanish
naval forces, which in the infancy of the great struggle they could not expect to
conquer, as very soon afterwards, in 1609, was done by Heemskerck. He burned the Spanish
fleet on their own shores, and thirty years later the gallant Admiral Marten Harpertszoon
Tromp carried his broom at the mast-head. The cosmographers of the Netherlands were
among the very best in the world, and were well acquainted with all the fruitless
endeavours to find a shorter route to the Indies by the north-west.
</p>
<p>Several voyages had been made by Englishmen, mentioned in Dr. Beke’s introduction,
towards the north-east, concerning which every particular was known in the Netherlands.
This has since been proved by an irrefutable fact; for the so-called journals of Barendsz,
which were in 1875 brought back to Norway, turned out to be a Dutch translation of
the journals of the English navigators, Pet and Jackman, who, in 1580, endeavoured
to find the north-east passage. This translation was found in the old wintering house
of Barendsz in Novaya Zemlya, and consequently he must have taken it with him on his
last voyage. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the Netherlanders had watched
eagerly, and with intense interest, the attempts made by the English to find the north-east
passage to <span class="pageNum" id="pbvi">[<a href="#pbvi">vi</a>]</span>the Indies. This may be the reason why a few Netherlanders tried at first to penetrate
over-land in that direction, for a certain Olivier Brunel succeeded in reaching as
far as the Obi river, travelling all the way on <i>terra firma</i>. Thanks to the industrious and intelligent researches of the historian of “De Noordsche
Compagnie”, Mr. S. Muller, Fz., we now know a great deal more of this Olivier Brunel
than Dr. Beke did in 1853.
</p>
<p>The history of Brunel has especially roused Mr. Muller’s interest, and the facts discovered
during his researches are so surprising that we think we cannot do better than give
them nearly <i>verbatim</i>.
</p>
<p>At the time that the English settled themselves at the mouth of the Dwina river, in
the neighbourhood of the monastery of St. Nicholas, they had spared no trouble to
maintain themselves continually in the exclusive possession of the trade in these
regions. In this they succeeded but for a short period.
</p>
<p>Twelve years after their arrival on the shores of the White Sea, the Dutch had found,
at least partially, the track of their predecessors.
</p>
<p>In the year 1565, a certain Philip Winterköning, an exile from Wardöhuis, entered
upon a negotiation with the Netherlanders. By his intervention a ship was sent out
from Enkhuizen, and arrived at a spot, where a settlement was soon formed, to which
they gave the name of Kola.
</p>
<p>In the following year, 1566, two merchants of Antwerp, Simon van Salingen and Cornelis
de Meyer, steering from Kola along the coast, ventured <span class="pageNum" id="pbvii">[<a href="#pbvii">vii</a>]</span>to follow in the track of the English to the White Sea. They landed at the mouth of
the Onega, and travelled, disguised as Russians, overland to Moscow. This courageous
voyage was undertaken for no other object than to settle private affairs; and they
did not avail themselves of the opportunity that thus occurred of establishing commercial
relations with the White Sea.
</p>
<p>However, the settlement at Kola now existed, and from thence efforts were made to
carry on a direct trade with the Dwina. A trustworthy person was sent for that purpose
on board of a Russian ship to Kholmogory, a town situated in the neighbourhood of
the English settlement of Rose Island. He was instructed to learn the Russian language,
and to try to obtain all possible information respecting the best manner of establishing
commercial relations. That man was no other than Olivier Brunel, a character well
known at that time, but in these days almost forgotten.
</p>
<p>His name ought to be remembered and honoured as it deserves, for Brunel was not only
the founder of the White Sea trade of the Dutch, but he was also their first Arctic
navigator. For this reason a better account of him than has been given in the former
edition, will not be found out of place here. Dr. Beke saw in Olivier Brunel and Alferius
two distinct persons, and did not agree with Hamel that they were the same individual.
It is, therefore, necessary in the first place to give Mr. S. Muller’s arguments as
to why he considers Hamel’s opinion the most trustworthy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbviii">[<a href="#pbviii">viii</a>]</span></p>
<p>We know (he says) that, in 1581, two persons, both going under the uncommon name of
Olivier (of whom the one was “<span lang="la">natione Belga</span>”, the other “<span lang="la">domo Bruxella</span>”), lived on the shores of the White Sea. When it is remarked that, in 1578, only
a few Netherlanders went to those shores, this conformity of name and country is indeed
very remarkable. The scholarship of both was the same. The one, Alferius, was, as
Balak says, no scholar, but a man of skilful practice; the other, Brunel, had passed
his life as a commercial discoverer in the north. There is also a striking conformity
in the condition of life of the two men. Alferius, “<span lang="la">captivus aliquot annos vixit in Moscovitarum ditione, apud viros illic celeberrimos
Jakonius et Unekius.</span>” Brunel was for a few years a prisoner in Russia, and was delivered from his captivity
by the Ameckers, who were very clever Russian merchants, living at Coolwitsogda, whom
Brunel afterwards served. Jakonius and Unekius had already been taken by Lütke, who
probably knew nothing of Brunel, to be the same as Jakov and Grigory Anikiew.
</p>
<p>Hamel was convinced that by the “Ameckers” the Anikiews from Sol-Wütschegodsk only
could be meant, although Scheltema, his authority, had changed arbitrarily “Coolwitsogda”
(Sol-Wütschegodsk) into “Cool” (Kola).
</p>
<p>To continue:—Alferius was sent to the Netherlands in 1581; Brunel went there every
year. We find Alferius journeying along the coast of the Baltic; Brunel often travelled
overland to Europe. <span class="pageNum" id="pbix">[<a href="#pbix">ix</a>]</span>Alferius, in the service of his masters, had often been at the Obi; Brunel had been
for years commercial agent of the Russians, who yearly traded with the Obi. Alferius
started from the Netherlands with the design of seeking out the north-east passage;
Brunel is known as the first Dutch Arctic traveller.
</p>
<p>In fine:—Brunel was one of the inciters of the Dutch Arctic voyages, and spoke, therefore,
with the South-Netherlander Moucheron. Alferius is known to have had the intention
of visiting the South-Netherlander Mercator, with whose co-operation Moucheron gave
that impulse which resulted in the first expedition of the Netherlanders to the Arctic
regions.
</p>
<p>From all this circumstantial evidence we must draw the conclusion that Alferius is
the same personage as Olivier Brunel, and, based upon this conclusion, the following
history of Brunel has been given by Mr. S. Muller.—
</p>
<p>Olivier Brunel was born at Brussels in the first part of the sixteenth century. Of
the early years of his life absolutely nothing is known. It may be that he went in
1565 with the first ships of Enkhuizen to Kola, or that, escaping from the tyranny
of the Spanish Duke of Alva, he came over to Holland, together with a number of South
Netherland merchant families, such as the Moucherons, the Le Maires, the Usselins,
and others. However, it is quite certain that, soon after the establishment of the
Netherlanders at Kola, he undertook the voyage to Kholmogory already alluded to. He
was not lucky <span class="pageNum" id="pbx">[<a href="#pbx">x</a>]</span>on that occasion, for, watched by the English, who feared him as a rival, he was handed
over to the Russian Government as a spy, and remained for several years a captive
at Jaroslav. At last assistance made its appearance in the persons of the brothers
Jakov and Grigory Anikiew, who belonged to the celebrated commercial house of the
Strogonoffs at Solvitchegodok. These latter asked and obtained his liberty of the
Czar.
</p>
<p>The generous merchants had every reason to felicitate themselves on the benefit conferred
upon Brunel. Their <i lang="fr">protégé</i> took a zealous and active part in the yearly expeditions which were made by the Russians
towards the East.
</p>
<p>Brunel passed overland through the territory of the Samoyeds to Siberia, as well as
by sea along the coast, and in one of his voyages, crossing the river of Petchora,
at last he reached the long-desired Obi river. In one of these expeditions, which
probably now and then went through the Matthew’s Strait, a passage well known to the
Russians, his guide, a Russian, brought him to Kostin Shar, a strait which by this
means became known to Europe.
</p>
<p>Soon, however, Brunel rendered himself of greater use to his masters by opening new
roads for their trade. Being acquainted with the Dutch colony at Kola, and with the
requisites for Dutch commerce, Brunel urged the plan of seeking towards the west for
a mart to dispose of Russian produce. To put his plan into execution he himself started,
accompanied by two relations of the Anikiews, and <span class="pageNum" id="pbxi">[<a href="#pbxi">xi</a>]</span>provided with passports from the Czar. He hired a Dutch ship, and arrived safely at
the city of Dort. There the Russian visitors found a ready market for the greater
part of their goods. The rest was advantageously sold at Antwerp and Paris, and when
Brunel next year returned to his patrons, the latter were well contented with the
results of the voyage. They decided upon entering into a <span class="corr" id="xd33e710" title="Source: negociation">negotiation</span> with Kola, and from thence with the Netherlands. In this manner Brunel, as commercial
agent of the Anikiews, yearly visited both places. This state of things did not last
long. Brunel made use of his favourable position to put into execution the plan to
accomplish which he had gone years before to Russia but with such bad success. He
made arrangements with a certain Jan van de Walle, and in 1577 persuaded him to make
a journey overland to Russia, accompanied by Brunel himself. Van de Walle made excellent
use of the knowledge gained by him on this expedition, for the year following a Dutch
ship under Captain Jan Jakobszmette Lippen, of Alkmaar, anchored for the first time
in the Pudoshemsco mouth of the Dwina. This ship, having on board Van de Walle as
agent, had sailed from Flushing and belonged to an Antwerp merchant named Gilles van
Eychelenberg. Almost at the same time another ship arrived, belonging to the well-known
Balthazar de Moucheron, and under the command of Adrian Crijt, a captain in the service
of Balthazar. Thus the commerce of the Netherlands with the White Sea was established.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxii">[<a href="#pbxii">xii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Soon after this, Melchior de Moucheron, as commercial agent of his <span class="corr" id="xd33e716" title="Source: re ation">relation</span> Balthazar, settled at the mouth of the Dwina, and the trading establishment was then
transferred to a harbour in the neighbourhood of the monastery of Saint Michiel. On
this spot, a few years subsequently, rose the city of Nova Kholmogory, commonly known
as Archangel.
</p>
<p>After some hesitation the English left their settlement on Rose Island and betook
themselves to the young, but already prosperous, city of Archangel.
</p>
<p>Two years had hardly passed after Brunel had set the Dutch trade with Russia on a
secure footing, when we find him occupied with still more gigantic and adventurous
designs.
</p>
<p>As we know, in the year 1580 the English expedition, under the commanders Pet and
Jackman, set out in search of the north-east passage. It was accompanied by the good
wishes of thousands of persons who assembled to see it start, whilst the whole scientific
world awaited with breathless expectation the result of this further effort. The Russians,
also, who at the mouth of the Dwina daily came into contact with the servants of the
Muscovy Company, doubtless heard of the expectations which were fostered about the
north-east passage.
</p>
<p>This being the case, surely it is not surprising that the Russians, possessing much
more accurate knowledge of the Siberian coast than the English, should try to make
use of that knowledge and also form plans to find the desired passage.
</p>
<p>A Swedish ship-builder, who had for some years <span class="pageNum" id="pbxiii">[<a href="#pbxiii">xiii</a>]</span>been occupied in the service of the Anikiews, received the order to construct two
ships fitted up with everything requisite for the exigencies of an Arctic expedition;
and, on the other hand, Brunel, the Dutch voyager, was instructed to proceed to Antwerp
and there hire, at almost any price, hardy sailors and mates, with whom these vessels
were to be manned.
</p>
<p>On his way thither, Brunel, in 1581, arrived at the Island of Oesel, in the Gulf of
Riga. Here he had an interview at Arensburg with a cosmographer named John Balak,
a friend of the renowned Gerard Mercator.
</p>
<p>Balak, who took much interest in voyages of discovery, and who seems to have appreciated
the enterprising genius of Brunel, gave him a letter of recommendation to Mercator
at Duisburg. From that letter, happily preserved by Hakluyt, we know the plans and
intentions of Brunel.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e730src" href="#xd33e730" title="Go to note 1.">1</a> But Brunel desired that his native country, and not his Russian benefactors, should
have the advantage of his researches. Acting upon this impulse, he, immediately after
his arrival in Holland, tried to find acceptance for his favourite scheme.
</p>
<p>It may, therefore, be supposed that a few merchants, and amongst them, beyond all
doubt, De Moucheron, influenced by the zealous persuasions of Brunel, proposed to
the noble Prince William the Taciturn a project for sending out an expedition in order
to try and discover the north-east passage to <span class="pageNum" id="pbxiv">[<a href="#pbxiv">xiv</a>]</span>the Indies. Probably they claimed the aid of the Government to support their efforts;
but the political situation of the country was too unsettled to allow the States to
risk their money in so doubtful an undertaking. Nevertheless, the prince himself was
greatly in favour of the expedition; yet, to support it with the funds of the nation
was out of the question.
</p>
<p>However, two such enterprising men as Brunel and De Moucheron were not so easily daunted;
for the first Netherland Arctic voyage was undertaken in 1584, and, in all probability,
was fitted out entirely at the expense of De Moucheron. But to Brunel belongs the
honour of the voyage. This indefatigable traveller sailed with a ship belonging to
the city of Enkhuizen, towards the north, to reach the far-off Empire of Cathay. Brunel,
like a true Dutchman of the period—for the Dutch were then merchants to the very core—occupied
himself on the way with entering into commercial relations with the Samoyed tribes.
</p>
<p>In the records of the Archives of Utrecht, among the papers of Buchelius, Mr. Muller
has discovered an old letter, in which it is recounted that Brunel had tried in vain
to pass through Pet Strait.
</p>
<p>Be this as it may, it is quite certain that his expedition was most unfortunate. On
his return home, his ship, freighted with a rich cargo of valuable furs, mountain-crystal,
and Muscovy glass, was wrecked in the shallow mouth of the Petchora river. Brunel,
after this sad occurrence, being <span class="pageNum" id="pbxv">[<a href="#pbxv">xv</a>]</span>perfectly aware that his country was unable at the moment to assist him in making
a new effort, and not daring to return to the service of his former masters, the Russians,
resolved to seek a new scene of action. Accordingly he presented himself to the King
of Denmark, and offered him his services, in order to try and find the long-lost Greenland
colonies. The proposal of the able Arctic traveller was eagerly accepted. Brunel immediately
entered into the Danish service, and did not abandon the task before three vain attempts,
made one after another, convinced him of the fruitlessness of his endeavours. But
little more is known of the remaining period of his life.
</p>
<p>Mr. Muller has called attention to some information furnished by Purchas’ <i>Pilgrimes</i> iii, p. 831, of which the following is an extract:—“The rest of this journall, from
the death of Master John Knight, was written by Oliuer Browne” (or Brownel,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e748src" href="#xd33e748" title="Go to note 2.">2</a> this last letter <i>l</i> is unfortunately not distinct).
</p>
<p>It may appear strange that so distinguished a seaman should have been on board a ship
in a subordinate position. Yet, in all likelihood, this is the true Brunel, for other
reasons justify the idea that he was in English service.
</p>
<p>Firstly, Josiah Logan, in 1611, knew very accurately how to describe the manner in
which Brunel had found “Kostin Shar”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e756src" href="#xd33e756" title="Go to note 3.">3</a> Those particulars he could not have known from the very brief <span class="pageNum" id="pbxvi">[<a href="#pbxvi">xvi</a>]</span>details given in the Dutch accounts. Either he must have been personally acquainted
with Brunel or have read something that was written by him.
</p>
<p>And, secondly, the fact that Brunel, after his failure in his Arctic voyage (1584),
had been constantly in Danish and English service, would account for his absence in
the later Dutch Arctic voyages, and would sufficiently explain the want of acquaintance
of Hessel Gerritsz with Brunel’s further researches.
</p>
<p>It, therefore, is by no means impossible that Brunel, together with Knight, quitting
the Danish for the English service, again visited the north-west. After this we lose
sight of Brunel. It is a great pity that the evening of the life of this great man
should be lost in total obscurity. Even the year of his death is not exactly known.
However, it is supposed to have taken place in the first years of the seventeenth
century, because, in 1613, Hessel Gerritsz wrote of Brunel’s voyage, as that of “Oliverii
cuiusdam Brunelli”.
</p>
<p>The above is the history of Brunel, as related by Mr. S. Muller.
</p>
<p>If his views are correct, then, in all probability, the first Dutch Arctic expedition
took place in 1584. Now, in that same year, the King of Spain prohibited to the inhabitants
of the Netherlands all trade with Portugal. Thus it is easy to comprehend that attention
was drawn towards the finding of a northern passage, which would have enabled the
Dutch to open a direct trade with the Indies. Consequently <span class="pageNum" id="pbxvii">[<a href="#pbxvii">xvii</a>]</span>during three successive years we see different expeditions leaving the Netherland
ports, and boldly penetrating into the Arctic seas.
</p>
<p>Dr. Beke has given, in his introduction, the principal outlines of the route taken
by these expeditions. However, led away by the example of the German geographer, Petermann,
Dr. Beke has made a mistake in laying down the track of Barendsz in his third voyage.
This can be proved almost mathematically by an extract taken from a log, probably
of Barendsz himself, which is preserved in the very rare work, “Histoire du Pays,
nommé Spitsbergen, etc., par Hessel Gerard, à Amsterdam, 1613.” This extract runs
thus:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“May 18, New Style. We set out from the Texel, and arrived on the 22nd at Fayril,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e774src" href="#xd33e774" title="Go to note 4.">4</a> and in the neighbourhood of the Orkneys.
</p>
<p>“June 5. We encountered ice, which, according to our estimation, came from Greenland;
for we judged from our calculations that we were about 100 nautical miles distant
from the said Greenland. The water was green with a brownish colour. Sounded without
finding any bottom. The ice extended the whole length of the sea, south-east and north-west,
and was either in pieces or in floes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e779src" href="#xd33e779" title="Go to note 5.">5</a>
</p>
<p>“The next day we made our way N.E. and N.E. ¼ N. for a distance of 36 miles, and came
upon a great ice-field, through which it was impossible to pass. Found no bottom at
120 fathoms. In our opinion, we were N.W. 220 miles <span class="pageNum" id="pbxviii">[<a href="#pbxviii">xviii</a>]</span>off Luffoden Island, and 400 to 460 miles from the North Cape.
</p>
<p>“Turning thence towards the east, we arrived at Bear Island on the 10th of June, in
74° 35′ latitude, and sailing N.E. we came upon an ice-field, against which we were
anchored, and were obliged to return under the island.
</p>
<p>“From Bear Island we set out, shaping our course W.N.W., thinking to find towards
the north a better passage; for those of the other vessel wished constantly to draw
towards the west, whilst I desired to go more eastwardly. We made until night, W.N.W.,
64 miles, and during the night till the morning, N.W., 60 miles.
</p>
<p>“June 14. Made till night, N. ¼ W., 88 miles. Then the weather clearing up, we found
ourselves in the neighbourhood of ice, and we fancied we could see land to the north,
but we were not certain.
</p>
<p>“June 15. We hove to, sounded, without finding bottom with 150 fathoms. Sailed until
noon S.E. and S.E. ¼ E., 20 miles, having attained 78¼° latitude. Then we sailed,
wind aft east, 28 miles; and afterwards, till night, N.N.E., 20 miles. We passed a
large dead whale, on which were several sea-gulls.
</p>
<p>“June 16. Foggy weather, wind west, we sailed until noon, N.N.E., 84 miles. Came into
the ice, and we had to keep away in order to follow the edge of the ice, N.E. 20 miles.
Again we had to put back S.E. 24 miles, clear of the ice, till shaping a course S.S.W.
16 miles, we came again in the ice, which was in the morning.
</p>
<p>“June 17. Weather calm until noon. We then found the latitude of 80° 10′. We tacked,
having the wind right ahead to keep clear from the ice (<i>estoyons passe si, ou 6 lieues?</i>) Wind till night, west; found bottom at 90 fathoms. During the whole watch we continued
steering S.S.W. 16 miles, having wind from the S.E. We then saw land, but still kept
on towards the W.S.W. The land trended for about 32 or 36 miles, from W. ¼ S., towards
E. ¼ N. <span class="pageNum" id="pbxix">[<a href="#pbxix">xix</a>]</span>It was high land, and entirely covered with snow, and it extended from the N.W. to
another point.
</p>
<p>“June 18. S.W. ¼ W. 24 miles, and there we found the latitude of 80°. With wind W.
and N.W. we sailed against the wind along the land till noon, the 20th. Then we had
the western point of the land S.S.W. 20 miles. Continued to sail S.S.W. and S.W. ¼
S., 20 miles, and came close to a large bay, which extended into the land towards
the south; and another bay, before which was an island, and that bay extended far
towards the south. Then sailed anew from the land, and till night continued steering
N.W. ¼ N., 8 miles, and came again in the ice, owing to which we had to return towards
the south.
</p>
<p>“June 21. It blew very hard and snowed much from the S.W., and we steered close to
the wind, until night, anchored close under the land, near our companion, just before
the entry of the channel. At 18 fathoms sandy bottom. At the east point of the mouth
was a rock, which was moreover split, a very good landmark. There was also a small
island or rock, about 1⅓ from that eastern one. On the west point also, was a rock,
very near.
</p>
<p>“June 22. Took in ballast of 7 boatsful of stones, thus much because our ship was
little ballasted. And came a great bear, swimming towards the ship, which we pursued
with three boats. He was killed, and his skin was 12 feet long. This day we entered
with the boat into the entry, to find a better port, which was necessary, and found
inside the land all separated and broken and some islands, where was good anchorage
in several spots.
</p>
<p>“June 23. Looked for our true meridian by means of the Astronomical Circle, and found
before noon 11, and after noon 16 degrees declination, that the compasses, or the
needle turned towards the N.W., so that the circle proved not correct. We went out
of the bay to seek how far the coast could extend itself, for the weather was very
clear. Could not perceive the end of the land, which extended itself S. ¼ E., 28 miles,
as far as a high and mountainous cape, <span class="pageNum" id="pbxx">[<a href="#pbxx">xx</a>]</span>which looked as if it was an island. At midnight took the altitude of the sun 13°,
so that we were at the latitude of 79° 24′.
</p>
<p>“June 24. Before noon it was calm, with the wind S.W. The land (along which we shaped
our course) was for the greatest part broken, rather high, and consisted only of mountains
and pointed hills; for which reason we gave it the name of ‘Spitsbergen’.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e807src" href="#xd33e807" title="Go to note 6.">6</a> We sailed about S.W. and S.W. ¼ S., 28 miles, and then we were about 40 or 48 miles
from the spot where we had anchored the first time more easterly.
</p>
<p>“In the evening, we again kept out from the land, the north-western point of it was
N.E. of us, and steered out of the coast W. and W. ¼ S., 32 miles. Until the end of
the first watch, sailed towards the east, and steered S.E., 32 miles, until noon of
the 25th. Then came close to the land, and sailed with wind aft, N.N.E., 8 miles.
And anchored behind a cape in 18 fathoms sandy bottom; and it seamed to us there was
ebb and flow, for we found in the time of 12 hours a current running from the S.W.
and another running from the N.E., so strong that the buoys of our anchors hid themselves
under the water. This bay, in which we were, ran rather far inland, with still another
interior creek; on the south side there was a low cape, behind which one could sail,
keeping along the northern coast and stopping behind the cape, having shelter from
all winds. Our men found there teeth of walrus or sea-cows, for which reason we called
that bay ‘Teeth-bay’. We also found there much dung of stags, and some wool as of
sheep. Just south of the cape was a little creek, like a harbour.
</p>
<p>“June 26. We had the wind north, made sail, and steered S. ¼ E., 40 miles. At noon
we arrived between the mountainous cape and the <i>terra firma</i>, thinking that the mountainous cape was an island. We sailed within S. ¼ E. and S.,
and being a little distance inside the cape, we found the depth 12 and 10 fathoms
good sandy bottom, and being <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxi">[<a href="#pbxxi">xxi</a>]</span>entered, 32 miles; there was a depth of 50 fathoms stony bottom, and the land was
all covered with snow. Entering about 20 miles between the cape and the coast of the
<i>terra firma</i>, we found that the cape, which we thought to be an island, was attached by a sand-bank
to the land; for we found a depth of 5 fathoms. There was ice on the shallows, so
that we were obliged to return. That cape, which we thought to be an island, lies
at 79° 5′ latitude; we called it ‘Cape Bird’, because there were so many birds upon
it and in the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>“June 27. It was calm, so that we remained floating, without being able to advance
between Cape Bird and the land.
</p>
<p>“June 28. We rounded it, and then sailed S.S.W., 24 miles, always keeping along the
land, which was very mountainous and sharp, with a beautiful shore. We sailed south
and S. ¼ E., 24 miles, and afterwards S. ¼ W., 12 miles. Found, at noon, the latitude
to be 78⅓°, and we were then in the neighbourhood of ice. Sailed same distance seaward,
to keep clear of the ice, and sailed thus along the edge of the ice and in the neighbourhood
of the land S.E. ¼ S., 28 miles. And then we were close to a large bay, which extended
itself in the land E.N.E., and was on both sides high and mountainous. Sailed with
N.N.E. wind abaft till night all along the coast, S.S.E. and S. ¼ W., 20 miles. Then
again there was a large bay, in which was much ice under the land. To keep out of
the ice we steered a little W.S.W., and sailed S. ¼ W., 16 miles. Came into the ice,
for which reason we sailed S.W. 12 miles.
</p>
<p>“June 29. Continued, with a north wind, to sail S.E. ¼ E. and S.S.E. 20 miles. All
along the coast, till noon, south 16 miles, and found at noon the latitude of 76°
50′. Sailed south and S.S.E. without finding land, until we saw Bear Island, on the
first of July.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This is all that Hessel Gerritsz has copied out of the log of Barendsz himself, as
he earnestly assures us.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxxii">[<a href="#pbxxii">xxii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dr. Beke, speaking in his introduction of this extract, says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Want of time and space prevents us from giving the subject any lengthened consideration.
But from what we have been able to make out, our impression decidedly is, that it
was never written by Barendsz, but was attributed to him solely for the purpose of
giving to it an authority which it might otherwise not have possessed.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Beke then gives his arguments in support of this opinion, and in order to refute
them Mr. Muller makes the following remarks:—
</p>
<p>I do not see (he says) why, after the death of Barendsz, the important ship’s log
should have fallen into the hands of an inferior officer, even had he been a friend
of the deceased. It would seem more probable, that after Barendsz’s death the skipper
and supercargo, Jakob Heemskerck, would have taken all possible care of that interesting
document, and, on his return to his native country, would have delivered it to Plancius,
or others entitled to it. Admitting that the log came into the hands of Plancius,
we are not at all surprised that he should allow the perusal of its contents by his
friend Hessel Gerritsz, to assist him in his work of proving that the Dutch were the
real discoverers of Spitsbergen.
</p>
<p>Dr. Beke’s chief argument against the authenticity of the extract above given, is
that in it, instead of Greenland, the newly discovered land is spoken of as being
Spitsbergen, a name, according to him, only given to that island years afterwards.
But Barendsz’s <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxiii">[<a href="#pbxxiii">xxiii</a>]</span>opinion that they sailed along Greenland is no reason why they should not have given
the name of Spitsbergen to a part of that coast.
</p>
<p>Mr. De Jonge, assistant-keeper of the Royal Archives at the Hague, and author of the
“History of the Dutch East Indies Company”, sets at least this question at rest by
making mention of evidence which he found in the Archives at the Hague, given by Barendsz’s
companion, Captain Rijp, before the magistrates of Delft, in which it is said:—“And
we gave to that land the name of Spitsbergen, for the great and high points that were
on it.”
</p>
<p>De Veer,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e840src" href="#xd33e840" title="Go to note 7.">7</a> it is true, does not make any mention of this name in his account, but the extract
from the ship’s log of William Barendsz, as Hessel Gerritsz gives it, contains other
peculiarities, which are not found in “De Veer”.
</p>
<p>Dr. Beke, moreover, brings a charge against Hessel Gerritsz of having intentionally
invented wrong courses, but there is no reason why he should have done so. For, in
order to prove the discovery of Spitsbergen by the Dutch, he had only to refer to
the work of “De Veer”, and the invention of new courses would in no respect have <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxiv">[<a href="#pbxxiv">xxiv</a>]</span>strengthened his arguments. The difference in the statements of the courses, and here
and there in the account of the circumstances, proves sufficiently that we have here
to do with two quite distinct documents.
</p>
<p>And then, as Mr. Muller remarks, the journal of Barendsz, which gives fewer anecdotes
but more courses, merits even more confidence than the indistinct statements of De
Veer. The very accurate account kept of the courses, as well as of the observations,
the total neglect of all that could give the journal an agreeable form, everything,
in fact, concerning it, marks the extract as being a log, that is to say, a work not
destined to be used as a pleasant history of the voyage. Moreover, Barendsz’s statements
are much more correct. Barendsz gives continually, and with great accuracy, the courses
which are often changed several times on the same day, whilst De Veer says repeatedly:
“The courses were about northerly”, without giving any further indication. Barendsz
gives what happened every day, whilst De Veer sometimes omits a few days. But the
journal of De Veer especially loses in value when we come to compare his account with
that of Barendsz. At once we perceive that he did not keep a strict daily account,
but rather that he had written it at different intervals during the voyage; for whilst
in the main points both accounts quite coincide, the chronology of De Veer is entirely
incorrect. Combining all these arguments, we may come to the final conclusion:—that
the extract given <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxv">[<a href="#pbxxv">xxv</a>]</span>by Hessel Gerritsz is truly taken from Barendsz’s log, and as such merits more credit
than the account of De Veer.
</p>
<p>This granted, we see that Barendsz’s true track does not go north along the east coast,
as Dr. Beke believes, but runs up along the west side of the land. Dr. Beke and Dr.
Petermann have supposed Barendsz to have sailed up the east side, and to have circumnavigated
the largest island in the group. This is not possible, for then Barendsz would have
known it to be an island, and therefore could never have thought it to be a part of
Greenland. The track as Dr. Petermann lays it down, has, up to the present day, never
been followed by any known ship, although in the last ten years many attempts have
been made.
</p>
<p>One of the most successful of these voyages was that of Captain Nilsen, a Norwegian,
who, in the remarkably favourable season of 1872, with his schooner <i>De Freia</i>, pushed as far as 79° 20′ N. latitude, the farthest point yet attained, on the east
coast of Spitsbergen, coming from the south. Arriving at the very entrance of Hinlopen
Strait, Captain Nilsen was prevented by impenetrable pack-ice from entering that strait,
and had, after sighting Cape Torell, to retrace his steps.
</p>
<p>The question whether Barendsz went north along the west or along the east coast of
Spitsbergen, has been fully treated by Mr. P.&nbsp;A. Tiele, archivaris at Leyden, who
has also demonstrated that the ship’s track, laid down in the chart of J. Hondius,
“Tabula <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxvi">[<a href="#pbxxvi">xxvi</a>]</span>Geographica” of the year 1598,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e861src" href="#xd33e861" title="Go to note 8.">8</a> has been printed after a drawing of William Barendsz himself.
</p>
<p>With the extract from the log of Barendsz in our hand, and following the chart, we
believe the true track of Barendsz’s third voyage to have been as follows:—
</p>
<p>On the 18th of May, 1596, the two ships left the Netherlands, and arrived on the 10th
of June at Bear Island; from whence they departed on the 13th, shaping their course
in a north-westerly direction.
</p>
<p>In the evening of the 14th, or in the morning of the 15th, they fancied they saw land.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e872src" href="#xd33e872" title="Go to note 9.">9</a>
</p>
<p>On the 15th they made more easting, till at the beginning of the first watch, when
they began to steer again more north. On this course they made, till noon of the 16th,
84 nautical miles. The weather was foggy, and prevented their seeing any land towards
the east. There they encountered ice, and sailed along the edge of it as much as the
wind allowed, and late on the 17th they saw high land, entirely covered with snow.
</p>
<p>Till noon of the 20th they continued, in latitude about 80°, to sail along that land,
when they had the western point of the land S.S.W., only 20 miles. Continuing to sail
S.S.W. and S.W. ¼ S., they passed two bays, which both stretched into the land towards
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxxvii">[<a href="#pbxxvii">xxvii</a>]</span>the south.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e880src" href="#xd33e880" title="Go to note 10.">10</a> In the evening of that day they made a fresh effort towards the N.W., but were again
hindered by the ice from pushing further north, and had to return, anchoring on the
evening of the 21st close under the land, in 18 fathoms, sandy bottom, surrounded
by several rocks, of which one was split, “very good to recognise”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e883src" href="#xd33e883" title="Go to note 11.">11</a>
</p>
<p>On the 22nd they inspected, with one of their boats, the north-westerly point of the
land, which they found to be only islands with many good anchorages.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e888src" href="#xd33e888" title="Go to note 12.">12</a>
</p>
<p>The following day they went out of the bay, and, the weather being very clear, they
saw the coast stretching in a southerly direction, and found at midnight the latitude
to be 79° 34′. In the evening they again made a vain effort to push farther in a more
westerly direction.
</p>
<p>On the 25th they anchored in a bay,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e894src" href="#xd33e894" title="Go to note 13.">13</a> about 10 miles north of a high point, which they afterwards christened Cape Bird.
That bay ran rather far inland, and by sailing round its northern shore, it was possible
on the south side of the bay to find shelter from all winds behind a low point.
</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 26th they weighed the anchor, made sail, and arrived at
noon between the <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxviii">[<a href="#pbxxviii">xxviii</a>]</span>mountainous cape and the terra firma.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e901src" href="#xd33e901" title="Go to note 14.">14</a> After sailing about 20 miles in a southerly direction, they saw much ice aground,
and on sounding they found only 5 fathoms. These shallows<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e904src" href="#xd33e904" title="Go to note 15.">15</a> obliged them to return, but having to strive with foul winds, and being becalmed,
they only, on the 28th, rounded the mountainous cape, which they called “Cape Bird”,
“because there were so many birds upon it and in the neighbourhood.” This cape lay
in 79° 5′ N. latitude.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e909src" href="#xd33e909" title="Go to note 16.">16</a> Steering about 60 miles in a southerly course, they came close to a large bay, which
ran into the land E.N.E.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e912src" href="#xd33e912" title="Go to note 17.">17</a> Twenty miles farther they passed another large bay,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e916src" href="#xd33e916" title="Go to note 18.">18</a> in which was “much ice under the land.” To keep clear of the ice the course now became
more westerly, and at noon on the 29th, in latitude 76° 50′, they lost sight of the
land.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e919src" href="#xd33e919" title="Go to note 19.">19</a> Sailing S. and S.S.E. they, on the 1st of July, returned to Bear Island, where they
agreed to separate.
</p>
<p>Barendsz, as we know, went to Novaya Zemlya, and Rijp steered again towards the north.
</p>
<p>In deciding whether Rijp steered along the west, or went north along the east coast,
opinions are again at variance. Hessel Gerritsz, in the same work, “Histoire de Spitsbergen,
etc.”, speaking on this question, says:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxxix">[<a href="#pbxxix">xxix</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Rijp and Barendsz, anchoring at Bear Island on the first of July, differed much in
their opinions. Rijp calculated that the spot where they were lay N.E. of the North
Cape in Norway, whilst Barendsz, on the contrary, maintained that it was N.W. Whilst
the calculations of Barendsz led him to believe that he was 1000 miles distant from
the Ice Cape of Novaya Zemlya, Rijp pretended to be only 250 miles distant from the
same point, and because Barendsz thought it better to extend his knowledge of a land
already somewhat known, and thus render easier the passage to the Strait of Anian,
they resolved to separate. They both agreed that Rijp should investigate towards the
north-west and Barendsz towards the N.E. So that Rijp again set sail towards the north,
and came, after marvellous accidents from ice and winds, to the spot where they had
anchored for the first time in 80°. He had also been up again to Cape Bird, and he
returned from thence with the intention of rejoining Barendsz.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This statement of Hessel Gerritsz that Rijp proceeded to the same spot in 80°, where
he had already been in company with Barendsz, agrees with the account of Pontanus
in his work on Amsterdam, published in 1614; as well as with the information of Rijp
himself, found in the old records by Mr. De Jonge.
</p>
<p>Pontanus (p. 168), says: “That Rijp pretended they ought to retrace their steps till
80°.” Whilst Rijp himself says “that they returned to the same spot where they had
first been” (<span lang="fr">et prévient au lieu où ils avoyent esté premièrement</span>).
</p>
<p>This granted, and with the experience of past navigators before us, to prove the almost
impossibility of going north along the east coast of Spitsbergen, <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxx">[<a href="#pbxxx">xxx</a>]</span>one would be inclined to conclude that Rijp must again have gone up along the west
coast.
</p>
<p>Dr. Beke’s opinion, “that nothing worthy of remark can have occurred to him, or otherwise
it could not have failed to be recorded”, seems fully borne out by later research.
</p>
<p>Sailing up to 80° N. latitude, Rijp found his further passage again intercepted by
that ice-barrier which (as we are now aware) yearly obstructs the sea north of Spitsbergen.
Not long after he sailed to Kola, and from thence returned home.
</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear why Barendsz and Rijp should have followed the west coast in
preference to the east. In his previous expeditions towards Novaya Zemlya, Barendsz
had had to contend with masses of ice constantly driven towards the west, so that
he had a perfect knowledge of the western current; and, consequently, he could not
expect to penetrate along the east coast, against which the ice would be accumulating.
</p>
<p>Not daunted in his heroic purpose by the remembrance of all the difficulties with
which he had to grapple along the coast of Novaya Zemlya in penetrating through the
pack ice, Barendsz decided upon again trying what could be done in that direction.
</p>
<p>Subsequent research has added nothing to Dr. Beke’s Introduction, as far as the further
voyage of Barendsz is concerned; but we are able to lay before our readers the results
of several other Arctic expeditions made by the Dutch after the return <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxi">[<a href="#pbxxxi">xxxi</a>]</span>on the 29th of October, 1597, of the survivors of Barendsz’s heroic companions.
</p>
<p>The results of the three voyages made before that date had been, as far as their real
object was concerned, insignificant, and could not be called an encouragement to make
another attempt to find the north-east passage; and, besides this, the necessity to
search for it no longer existed.
</p>
<p>In the same year in which Heemskerck and his companions entered the Maas, Houtman
returned to the Netherlands with the first Dutch fleet coming from the East Indies.
He had found, without great difficulty, his way to the East Indies, around the Cape
of Good Hope, and consequently there was no longer any necessity to find a new route
through the Polar ice.
</p>
<p>But when, in 1602, the Dutch East India Company was established, and received, by
its charter (to the detriment of all other Netherlands ship-owners), the exclusive
permission to sail to the East Indies round the Cape of Good Hope or round Cape Horn,
a new inducement was given to the interlopers to seek the northern passage. The East
India Company saw the danger which threatened it on that side, and was compelled,
in its own interests, if possible, to be the first to discover the north passage,
hoping thus to obtain the monopoly of the northern, as it already possessed that of
the southern route.
</p>
<p>The origin of most of the subsequent expeditions can be traced back to the contest
between monopoly and free trade.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxii">[<a href="#pbxxxii">xxxii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hudson, the celebrated English navigator, had just returned from his voyage in 1608,
when the East India Company seized the opportunity, and invited him over to the Netherlands,
desiring to retain him in their service. After long <span class="corr" id="xd33e957" title="Source: negociations">negotiations</span>, an agreement was entered into, in which Hudson engaged to seek the north-east passage.
Accordingly, on the 6th of April, 1609, Hudson started from the Texel in a small vessel
called <i>De Halve Maan</i> (the Half Moon).
</p>
<p>But among the interlopers was one Isaac le Maire, a clever merchant and an inveterate
adversary of the Company, who, seeing the preparations made for the departure of Hudson,
had not remained inactive. Thirty days later, by his zealous exertions, another ship
was fitted out, in order, if possible, to out-do Hudson, and, consequently, the hated
East India Company. This expedition was under the command of Melchior van Kerckhoven,
who left the Dutch ports on the 5th of May, 1609.
</p>
<p>Hudson had gone out with instructions to follow the example of Barendsz, in seeking
for a passage north of Novaya Zemlya. On this occasion he was again unfortunate; for,
as on his preceding voyage in 1608, he could not succeed in rounding Novaya Zemlya.
</p>
<p>On the 5th of May he arrived at the North Cape of Norway; but before he had sighted
Novaya Zemlya he was obliged by his mutinous crew to return.
</p>
<p>On the 19th he again passed the North Cape, and <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxiii">[<a href="#pbxxxiii">xxxiii</a>]</span>from thence sailed towards the N.W. to make new discoveries in that direction. In
this he was much more successful.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the expedition of Isaac le Maire came to no better result. Melchior
van Kerckhoven penetrated some distance into Pet Strait, but finding it perfectly
blocked by ice of extraordinary thickness, he was obliged to return without having
effected his object.
</p>
<p>Both these expeditions tended to confirm the opinion already entertained of the great
difficulty of finding, in that direction, the passage to the Indies. The number of
those who maintained the possibility of finding a way straight across the Pole daily
increased. So early as 1527 an Englishman, Robert Thorne, who lived at Sevilla, had
strongly recommended this direction for reaching the Indies. A warm defender of his
doctrines was found in the Dutch cosmographer Plancius. Maintainer of the existence
of an open Polar Sea, Plancius argued that the cold gradually augmented as far as
66° latitude, but that from thence to the Pole it again decreased.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, when in 1610 a certain Helisarius Roslin, medical doctor at Buchsweiler
and court physician to the Count of Hanau, presented to the States a small book, in
which he attributed the ill-luck of the former expeditions only to taking the wrong
direction, this coincided with the views of the supporters of the doctrines proclaimed
by Plancius.
</p>
<p>Consequently, in the year following, two Netherlanders, <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxiv">[<a href="#pbxxxiv">xxxiv</a>]</span>Ernst van de Wal and Pieter Aertsz de Jonge, requested the States-General and the
Admiralty of Amsterdam to assist them in fitting out a new expedition. They positively
believed they would find the northern passage, and jokingly remarked: “<i>That the sun at the far north was rather a manufacturer of salt than of ice</i>”. The plan, notwithstanding the disapprobation of many, found support, and in 1611
the Admiralty of Amsterdam decided on giving their sanction to the new expedition.
Two ships, <i lang="nl">De Vos</i> and <i lang="nl">De Craen</i>, were fitted out for the voyage. As commander of the expedition, Jan Cornelisz May,
surnamed “The Man-Eater”, was appointed. This experienced and skilful sailor had already
been, in 1598, among the first Dutch navigators to round the Cape of Good Hope on
his way to the Indies. On board of the ship <i lang="nl">De Vos</i> Ernst van de Walle was appointed supercargo and Pieter Fransz mate. The ship <i lang="nl">De Craen</i>, with Pieter Aertsz de Jonge as supercargo and Cornelis Jansz Mes as mate, was commanded
by Symon Willemsz Cat.
</p>
<p>On the 18th of March, 1611, the ships started; but, instead of going straight north,
they again sailed towards Novaya Zemlya, visited Kostin Shar, but were prevented by
the ice from penetrating into the Kara Sea. The ships were so damaged by their collisions
with the ice, that they were obliged to return to Kildin to repair. From thence they
sailed to North America, wintered there, and afterwards explored the coast-line between
47° and 42½′ N. latitude. <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxv">[<a href="#pbxxxv">xxxv</a>]</span>In one of the attempts to land, Pieter Aertsz de Jonge was killed by the natives.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1612 the <i lang="nl">De Craen</i> returned to Holland, but Captain May, with his ship the <i lang="nl">De Vos</i>, sailed again towards Novaya Zemlya, where he arrived on the 30th of June, 1612.
Setting out from thence he sailed to the north, along the coast of the island; but,
notwithstanding his great perseverance, he met with no better success. He was checked
by a vast barrier of ice, which stretched itself from the land in a north-westerly
direction. He followed the edge of it until the 14th of July, when he had attained
the latitude of 77°, and then returned to the coast of Novaya Zemlya, where he arrived
on the 20th.
</p>
<p>Between the 29th of July and the 9th of August he renewed his endeavours, and came
as far as 77° 45′ N. His attempt to sail straight to the Pole proved a complete failure.
</p>
<p>On the 26th of August he resolved to give up his trials, and to return to Holland,
where he safely anchored about the 15th of September. Yet all these misfortunes did
not affect the courage of the enterprising Netherlands merchants.
</p>
<p>The many ships which in the following years left the Dutch ports, bound on voyages
of discovery, were, however, without one exception, sent towards the north-west, where
Hudson, in the last years, had gathered such unfading laurels. All these trials to
the north-west gave, however, no better results than those to the north-east, and
after many fruitless expeditions <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxvi">[<a href="#pbxxxvi">xxxvi</a>]</span>in a north-western direction, we see, in the year 1624, a return to the old plans
of the sixteenth century, which were all based on the principle of following a coast-line.
</p>
<p>A ship called <i>De Kat</i>, with twenty-four hands on board, and provided with stores for two years and a half,
was fitted out to renew the investigations towards the north-east. Cornelis Fennisz
Bosman was appointed commander of the expedition, whilst Willem Joosten Glimmer accompanied
him as supercargo.
</p>
<p>As late as the 24th of June they left the Texel with the design to sail along the
Russian coast through Pet Strait, in the direction of the Obi. From thence they intended
to try to reach Cape Fabin, and seek through Strait Anian the way to Cathay. The highest
expectations were entertained of this expedition, but the result did not bear them
out.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of July, passing the island of Kalgojew, they reached Novaya Zemlya on
the 28th in 70° 55′ N.
</p>
<p>On the 10th of August they entered Pet Strait, and only by great exertion did they
succeed in pushing through it.
</p>
<p>But on the 17th, when the sails were frozen as hard as a plank, so as to render all
working of the ship impossible, the wind drove the ice-floes with such force against
the ship, that it was driven back in the direction of Pet Strait. Anchoring in the
strait, they had to contend with very heavy storms. <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxvii">[<a href="#pbxxxvii">xxxvii</a>]</span>The ship was parted from her anchors, and the strait getting choked with ice, they
resolved to retreat.
</p>
<p>Upon the return of Bosman to Holland in the beginning of September, without having
effected his object, the public was greatly disappointed, and almost denied the strenuous
efforts he had made to conquer all difficulties. It seems that after this bad success
the Netherlands merchants gave up all trials towards the north-east.
</p>
<p>The English and Russians who afterwards continued to seek for a passage in that direction
did not meet with better success.
</p>
<p>In the year 1676 an English expedition was sent towards the north-east; but the commander,
Wood, only explored the edge of the ice between Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya, without
rounding this latter island.
</p>
<p>Russian walrus-hunters and fishermen have also made many excursions in the seas around
Novaya Zemlya. The greater part of the Russian expeditions were made with the object
of reaching the Siberian rivers. Seldom did they go along the east coast northward
of Matthew’s Strait. In the <i lang="de">Archiv für Wissenschäftliche Kunde <span class="corr" id="xd33e1029" title="Source: van">von</span> <span class="corr" id="xd33e1032" title="Source: Rusland">Russland</span></i>, these excursions are described more or less completely. Chronological order is adhered
to, and this rather detailed account of the Russian expeditions extends from the year
1690 down to the voyages of Lütke, Bäer, and Krüsenstern.
</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable recorded is that of <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxviii">[<a href="#pbxxxviii">xxxviii</a>]</span>the Russian navigator, Sawwä Löschkin, in 1760, of which it is written:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“That in the year 1760 a certain Sawwä Löschkin from Olonoz, formed the bold design
of exploring the east coast of Novaya Zemlya, because this coast, till then never
visited by Russian hunters, would surpass all other places in abundance of fur-animals.
From this account of the expedition, which in a nautical point of view has never been
surpassed, we know that Löschkin sailed along the east coast from Burrough Strait,
as far as the N.E. point of Novaya Zemlya in 76° 9′. During this unprecedented voyage
he had to overcome so many obstacles, in consequence of the ice, that he was obliged
to winter twice on the east coast, and to use three summers in sailing to the N.E.
point.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This information leads Mr. de Jonge to the conclusion that Löschkin must have wintered
much more southwardly than Barendsz, else he would not have wanted three summers to
reach the north-east point. For the rest, that the Russians seldom visited the north-east
coast of Novaya Zemlya may be proved from the fact that, on a chart of the Northern
Polar Sea of 1864, drawn after Russian data and published in the review of Erman,
above alluded to, the north-east coast of Novaya Zemlya is laid down between 75° N.
and 76° 59′, as being very uncertain and doubtful, and only with the three old Dutch
names—“Ice Harbour, Cape Flessingue, and Cape of Desire”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1044src" href="#xd33e1044" title="Go to note 20.">20</a>
</p>
<p>The Russian admiral, Lütke, who was employed in surveying the coast of Novaya Zemlya
from 1821 to 1824, made all his attempts along the west coast, without being able,
however, to round Cape Nassau. <span class="pageNum" id="pbxxxix">[<a href="#pbxxxix">xxxix</a>]</span>All these trials, made towards the north-east, fully show us the great difficulties
which Barendsz had to encounter, and the gallant perseverance which enabled him to
penetrate thus far into the frozen seas. A greater proof of this exists in the fact
that in 1872 we find that the steamer <i>Tegethof</i>, under the skilful command of Lieutenant Weyprecht, not only failed in rounding Novaya
Zemlya, but was entirely closed in by the mighty ice-floes, and driven powerlessly
towards the north-east. However, the sea north of Novaya Zemlya was not always found
obstructed by the ice. During a favourable season ships could penetrate far to the
north-east without the slightest difficulty. This was often proved by the old Dutch
whalers or walrus-hunters, who, sailing north of Novaya Zemlya, even passed into the
Kara Sea.
</p>
<p>The journal of Gerrit de Veer sufficiently proves that the year 1596 was by no means
a favourable season. The Dutch walrus-hunters, among others Theunis Ys, Cornelis Roule,
and William de Vlamingh,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1057src" href="#xd33e1057" title="Go to note 21.">21</a> repeatedly frequented these seas north of Novaya Zemlya; but we find no mention made
of their having discovered Barendsz’s winter quarters. Skipper William de Vlamingh
seems to have passed nearest to it. Witsen, in his work, <i>North and East Tartary</i>, speaks of this skipper’s voyage thus:—<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1067src" href="#xd33e1067" title="Go to note 22.">22</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxl">[<a href="#pbxl">xl</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“I was informed by skipper William de Vlamingh of Oost Vlielend, that when he sailed
in the year 1664 to catch whales, he succeeded in passing along the northern shore
of Novaya Zemlya, and rounded the N.E. point of the island in order to try and be
more prosperous in his fishery than he had been towards the west. Steering S. and
S.W. he came near or about the house in which Heemskerck had wintered in the year
1596. From the house he sailed E.S.E. till in about 74° latitude, where he saw nothing
but open water. He afterwards sailed back in the same direction, and 16 days after
having lost sight of Novaya Zemlya he again anchored in the Vlie.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Combining all the information we find in the work of Witsen, there are reasons for
believing that De Vlamingh went on shore on the west and on the north coasts of Novaya
Zemlya, but not on the east coast.
</p>
<p>Mr. de Jonge, speaking about this whaling cruise, remarks:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“According to this account Vlamingh would have been near the house of Barendsz or
thereabout, but Witsen does not say that Vlamingh went on shore there. This information
leads us to conclude that Vlamingh did not see the wintering house at all, but simply
presumed that he had been near to it or thereabout, or else surely he would not have
failed to have mentioned it.<span class="corr" id="xd33e1082" title="Not in source">”</span></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>For the rest, the account of Witsen is rather vague, and exclusively depends upon
verbal communications. These old voyages of the Dutch walrus-hunters, as well as those
of the Norwegian fishermen in the present day, clearly show us that here, as well
as in every other part of the Arctic Regions, a favourable season might allow the
fortunate <span class="pageNum" id="pbxli">[<a href="#pbxli">xli</a>]</span>navigator who happens to be on the spot to penetrate in a few days further than any
of his predecessors, notwithstanding their unequalled perseverance and energy.
</p>
<p>Within the last ten years the Norwegians, like the Dutch walrus-hunters of old, have
been making continual inroads into the Kara Sea. This has been principally due to
the discovery of rich fishing-grounds in that direction. The first of these Norwegian
explorers was Captain Carlsen. With a small fishing-boat of Hammerfest he sailed through
Pet Strait, and, following the Siberian coast, he reached White Island, near the mouth
of the Obi river, without having fallen in with any signs of ice. It was, indeed,
a bold undertaking to penetrate thus with so small a boat into the Kara Sea; but Captain
Carlsen was fully rewarded for the risk he had run, in making a vast capture of blubber-yielding
animals, which handed him over a profit of £1,100.
</p>
<p>The voyage of the intrepid English walrus-hunter, Captain Palliser, who in that same
season sailed as far as the north coast of Novaya Zemlya, was of no less importance.
Being about half a degree north of Cape Nassau, he fell in with extensive ice-fields,
which, however, were soon broken up by stormy weather.
</p>
<p>Captain Palliser writes:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“After the ice was broken up and driven away by the heavy gales, I believe I could
have circumnavigated all Novaya Zemlya without much trouble. We were however prevented
from doing so, on account of having on board <span class="pageNum" id="pbxlii">[<a href="#pbxlii">xlii</a>]</span>the crew of a wrecked fishing smack. For this reason a great decrease in our provisions
had taken place, and consequently our store would not have been sufficient for so
long a voyage.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Captain Palliser then shaped his course south, came through Matthew’s Strait into
the Kara Sea, and penetrated to within three or four miles of White Island.
</p>
<p>However, both these voyages were surpassed in intrepidity by the interesting cruise
of the Norwegian, Captain Johannesen.
</p>
<p>On the 1st of May 1869, the schooner <i>Nordland</i>, Captain E.&nbsp;H. Johannesen, anchored at the Mersduscharsky Island, south of Kostin
Shar. After sailing for some time in the direction of Burrough Strait, Captain Johannesen
changed his course northwardly, and keeping the west coast continually in sight, he
eventually passed Matthew’s Strait on the 9th of June.
</p>
<p>Ten days later he was close to Cape Nassau, where he experienced a strong easterly
current.
</p>
<p>From here, turning south, the <i>Nordland</i> sailed on the 17th of July through Matthew’s Strait, and running south in the land-water
along the east coast, Captain Johannesen was, on the 26th July, in Burrough Strait.
At once he resolved to penetrate into the Kara Sea. He followed the low coast of the
country of the Samoyeds in an easterly and afterwards north-easterly direction, and
found himself on the 8th of August in the immediate neighbourhood of White Island
without having been hindered by the ice.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxliii">[<a href="#pbxliii">xliii</a>]</span></p>
<p>The day following he shaped his course north-west, and attained, on the 15th of August,
the estimated latitude of 75° 6′ N. and 71° E. longitude, where he encountered his
first ice. Thence, in a westerly direction, he returned to Novaya Zemlya, which he
sighted on the 20th in 75° 10′ N. latitude and 64° E. longitude. He now sailed along
the east coast, and passed through Burrough Strait on his homeward voyage. He had
repeatedly encountered a heavy swell from the south-east, but had scarcely met with
ice. He must, undoubtedly, have been close to Barendsz’s winter house, which is placed
by Captain Carlsen in 76° 12′ N. latitude and 68° E. longitude.
</p>
<p>Induced by these advantageous voyages, several Norwegian fishermen entered the Kara
Sea in the following year.
</p>
<p>Again the skilful Captain Johannesen made a cruise which almost surpassed his former
one, having this time circumnavigated Novaya Zemlya, a feat never before achieved.
He visited the east coast of that island, passing close to, but without perceiving,
Barendsz’s winter quarters.
</p>
<p>F. Torkildsen, commander of the schooner <i>Alpha</i>, was less fortunate. On the 24th of June he passed through Burrough Strait and entered
the Kara Bay, where he, on the 13th of July, in 68° 40′ N. latitude and 68° E. longitude,
lost his ship. The crew was, however, saved. Captain E.&nbsp;A. Ulve sailed with his schooner
<i>Samson</i> along the west coast of Novaya Zemlya, and on the 1st of August attained the high
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxliv">[<a href="#pbxliv">xliv</a>]</span>latitude of 76° 47′ in 59° 17′ E. longitude, without sighting any ice.
</p>
<p>Entering on the 8th of August through Matthew’s Strait into the Kara Sea, and keeping
between White Island and the Island of Vaigat, he, on the 24th of August, when homeward-bound,
sailed through Burrough Strait.
</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;E. Mack, with his schooner <i>Polarstern</i>, found, on the 5th of July, Matthew’s Strait blocked up with ice; but thirteen days
afterwards he sailed through it, and after crossing the Kara Sea in all directions,
returned on the 21st of August through Burrough Strait.
</p>
<p>Another navigator, Captain P. Quale, pushed more eastwardly. With his yacht, the <i>Johan Mary</i>, he, in the latitude of 75° 20′ N., attained the longitude of 74° 35′, and thus found
himself eastward of the meridian which goes across the mouth of the Obi River.
</p>
<p>The following year, encouraged by the partial success of these cruises, we find the
Norwegian seal-hunters again entering this new and prosperous ground. The southern
entries being closed by the ice, the captains directed their course northwardly, in
order to penetrate into the Kara Sea by rounding Novaya Zemlya.
</p>
<p>Passing over in silence the cruises of Captain F.&nbsp;C. Mack and those of the brothers
Johannesen, we come to the interesting voyage of Captain Carlsen, the first navigator,
who, since 1597, has entered the Ice Harbour of Barendsz. Captain Elling Carlsen,
with <span class="pageNum" id="pbxlv">[<a href="#pbxlv">xlv</a>]</span>his sloop <i>The Solid</i>, left the harbour of Hammerfest on the 22nd of May, 1871. When rounding the North
Cape of Norway, he met with very heavy squalls and snow-storms from the north-west.
</p>
<p>On the 28th he passed Vardo, and on the 10th of June, in 68° N. latitude and 40° 36′
E. longitude, at the northern outlet of the White Sea, he fell in with the first ice.
On the 16th of June he met two other ships, of which the one had already killed five
hundred and the other a thousand seals.
</p>
<p>On the 19th of July Captain Carlsen reached the coast of Novaya Zemlya, in the neighbourhood
of Mersduscharsky Island, and shaping his course towards the north, he passed Cape
Nassau, rounded Novaya Zemlya, and anchored on the 18th of August at Cape Hooft, on
the east coast.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of August, when he had advanced in a southerly direction almost as far
as 76° N. latitude, he observed much drift ice at a distance of forty miles from the
coast.
</p>
<p>On the 29th of August Carlsen again steered north, and anew anchored at Cape Hooft.
North of Matthew’s Strait, Captain Carlsen had fallen in with Captain F. Mack, who
was provided with better instruments, supplied by the Meteorological Institution at
Christiania. By means of these instruments, both captains made very correct observations,
with such success that they noted down the north-east point of Novaya Zemlya as lying
in 67° 30′ E. longitude, instead of in 73°, as was given in the latest charts. They
found that the land to the north-east <span class="pageNum" id="pbxlvi">[<a href="#pbxlvi">xlvi</a>]</span>of Novaya Zemlya lay pointing more towards the north than to the north-east, as given
in the previous charts. These observations proved the calculations of the old Dutch
navigators to have been perfectly correct, and restored to them the reputation of
which they had been so long defrauded.
</p>
<p>As for the subsequent part of Captain Carlsen’s voyage, we had better follow his own
ship’s log. In it he says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Sept. 7. Strong breeze from the south with weather overcast, and two reefs in the
mainsail. Anchored in the afternoon under the land near Barendsz harbour, where Barendsz
wintered. Pumped the ship free.
</p>
<p>“Friday, 8. Gale from the west with detached sky. We began to flinch (the animals
we had caught on the 6th). Afternoon we finished flinching and repaired the gaff,
which was broken. Let go also our port anchor. 8 o’clock pumped the ship free. During
the night strong breeze.
</p>
<p>“Saturday, 9. Strong breeze from the S.W. Sky overcast. 8 o’clock forenoon we went
under sail and coursed south along the land. 6 o’clock in the afternoon, we saw walrus
on the ice, boats were lowered, and we caught two of them; we also saw a house on
shore, which had fallen down. At noon we observed the latitude 76° 12′, the distance
from shore guessed. The house on shore was 16 metres long by 10 metres broad, and
the fir-wood planks, of which it was composed, were 1½ inches thick by from 14 to
16 inches broad, and as far as we could make out they were nailed together. The first
things we saw amongst the ruins of the house were two ships’ cooking pans of copper,
a crowbar or bar of iron, a gun-barrel, an alarum, a clock, a chest in which was found
several files and other instruments, many engravings, a flute, and also a few articles
of dress. There were also two other chests, but they <span class="pageNum" id="pbxlvii">[<a href="#pbxlvii">xlvii</a>]</span>were empty, only filled up with ice, and there was an iron frame over the fire-place
with shifting bar.
</p>
<p>“Sunday, 10. Light breeze from the N.W., almost calm, clear sky, we sailed along the
coast S.S.E. In the afternoon we caught two walrus. 8 o’clock pumped the ship free.
During the whole night calm.
</p>
<p>“Monday, 11. Light breeze from the west. Sky overcast. In the afternoon the wind freshened
from the west. We put three reefs in the mainsail. 8 o’clock pumped the ship free.
The whole night gale from the S.W.
</p>
<p>“Tuesday, 12. Gale from the S.W. We are obliged to return to Ledenaji Bay (Ice Harbour),
where, on the evening of the 9th we had found the ruined house. At noon we anchored
in the bay, and went again on shore and found several things, viz., candlesticks,
tankards with lid of zinc, a sword, a halberd head, two books, several navigation
instruments, an iron chest already quite rusted.
</p>
<p>“Wednesday, 13. Gale from the W.N.W. At noon we went under sail, but as we made a
little south the wind shifted to the S.W., and in order to keep off we had to let
go both anchors. Storm with snow. 8 o’clock pumped the ship free. During the night,
light breeze.
</p>
<p>“Thursday, 14. Calm with clear sky. 4 o’clock in the morning we went ashore further
to investigate the wintering place. On digging we found again several objects, such
as drumsticks, a hilt of a sword, and spears. Altogether it seemed that the people
had been equipped in a war-like manner, but nothing was found which could indicate
the presence of human remains. On the beach we found pieces of wood which had formerly
belonged to some part of a ship, for which reason I believe that a vessel has been
wrecked there, the crew of which built the house with the materials of the wreck and
afterwards betook themselves to the boats. Five sailors’ trunks were still in the
house, which might also have been used as 5 berths, at least as far as we could make
out. We now set to work to build a cairn, and erected a wooden pole 20 feet high.
We placed in the <span class="pageNum" id="pbxlviii">[<a href="#pbxlviii">xlviii</a>]</span>cairn a description of what we had found, shut up in a double tin-case, after which
we returned on board and went under sail. At noon the wind was N.E., observed latitude
about 76° 7′ N., longitude 68° E. (Greenwich). We steered in the direction S. by W.
along the land. 8 o’clock pumped the ship free. The whole night light breeze.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Thus far, we have let the log speak for itself. After having quitted the house, Carlsen
intended to return home by circumnavigating the island. Following, therefore, the
east coast in a southerly direction, he soon passed several icebergs.
</p>
<p>On the 16th of September he fell in with much ice, which probably by the west and
north-west wind was driven from the land.
</p>
<p>On the 18th it froze so stiff that they had to cut their way through the ice.
</p>
<p>On the 19th, being becalmed, the ship could move neither forward nor backward. During
the afternoon the wind freshened from the south-west, upon which they tried to approach
nearer to the land.
</p>
<p>On the 20th they had again to cut their way through the ice, which was already strong
enough to bear them. Till eight o’clock in the evening they worked to reach a lead
close to the land.
</p>
<p>On the 21st, Carlsen, in about 74° N. latitude, was, during a storm from the north-east,
in great danger of losing his ship. Closed in by the ice, he drifted that and both
the following days with the ice, in a south-western direction, during which time he
could see from the crow’s nest open water towards the north-east and east. Not before
the 30th of <span class="pageNum" id="pbxlix">[<a href="#pbxlix">xlix</a>]</span>September, in 72° 25′ N. latitude, did he again succeed in reaching open water, thus,
fortunately, escaping a fate similar to that of Barendsz.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p.xlixwidth" id="p.xlix"><img src="images/p.xlix.jpg" alt="RELICS FOUND IN THE BARENTS’ HOUSE IN NOVAYA ZEMLYA." width="720" height="486"><p class="figureHead">RELICS FOUND IN THE BARENTS’ HOUSE IN NOVAYA ZEMLYA.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 3rd of October he sailed through Burrough Strait, and anchored on the 4th of November
at Hammerfest, thanking God for his prosperous voyage. Thus Carlsen (like a true seaman)
ends his log.
</p>
<p>News of the discovery, by Captain Elling Carlsen, of a great number of relics on the
beach of Ice Harbour, was soon spread in Hammerfest. In consequence, on the 12th of
November, 1871, in the Hammerfest newspaper called <i>Finmarksposten</i>, there appeared a leading article entitled “Captain Elling Carlsen’s Voyage around
Novaya Zemlya”. A detailed account was given in it of the old Dutch voyages towards
the north-east. Notwithstanding some faults, the article was in its main points correct,
and proved that in the far North of Europe the expeditions of Barendsz had attained
a legendary celebrity.
</p>

<div class="figure p.xlix-2width" id="p.xlix-2"><img src="images/p.xlix-2.jpg" alt="RELICS FOUND IN THE BARENTS’ HOUSE IN NOVAYA ZEMLYA" width="720" height="480"><p class="figureHead">RELICS FOUND IN THE BARENTS’ HOUSE IN NOVAYA ZEMLYA</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>About the discovery of the winter quarters at Novaya Zemlya the <i>Finmarksposten</i> communicates a few details which seem to have been given to the writer by Carlsen
himself.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“After a lapse of 275 years” (says the Finmarksposten), “Captain Carlsen found himself
in the very spot where, in 1596, Barendsz and his companions had come on shore, and
near to the ruins of the simple hut constructed by the unfortunate Dutchmen. Captain
Carlsen, as far as lay in his power, made researches on and about the spot, but the
season being far advanced and the obligation he was under of circumnavigating Novaya
Zemlya, obliged him to seize the first opportunity of proceeding on his voyage. Consequently
<span class="pageNum" id="pbl">[<a href="#pbl">l</a>]</span>on the 10th of September, without having brought his work to a conclusion, he was
obliged to sail.
</p>
<p>“On the 10th and 11th he remained cruising, but in the evening of the latter day he
found himself under the necessity of returning to Ice Harbour, and thus he was enabled
to proceed with his investigations.
</p>
<p>“On the 13th he set sail, but was again forced to return and anchor.
</p>
<p>“On the 14th he was enabled to complete his researches. The house, fallen completely
into decay, was so to speak covered and almost hermetically enclosed by a thick layer
of ice. All the objects were likewise covered by a thick sheet of ice, and this explains
the excellent condition in which many of the articles were found. Such was their unimpaired
condition that one would be inclined to suppose that they had been placed there but
a short time previously, and one never would believe that they had, during almost
three centuries, been left uncared for. The house, as far as Captain Carlsen could
make out, was 16 metres long by 10 broad, and nailed together out of fir-wood planks
1½ inches thick by from 14 to 16 inches broad. The house was in part constructed out
of the materials of the wrecked ship, indications of which still existed in the remnants
of a few oaken timbers scattered on the beach. The house seemed to have contained
for the occupants 5 standing bed-places. There were 5 ship’s chests, which were however
too decayed to be taken away. In two of the chests were found a few instruments, such
as files, sledge-hammer, a borer, two pairs of compasses, a few caulking-irons, engravings,
a flute, pieces of navigation instruments, as well as a few books in the Dutch language,
which latter makes it almost certain that the relics belonged to Barendsz and his
companions of the year 1596. In the centre of the house, where the fireplace had probably
stood, a great iron frame was found, on which two ship’s copper cooking pans still
remained. A few porringers were so rotten that one could only take away their copper
mountings. In addition to <span class="pageNum" id="pbli">[<a href="#pbli">li</a>]</span>these were found candlesticks and tin-tankards, a crow-bar, two or more gunbarrels,
a gunlock, an alarum with the clock and clock weight belonging to it, a great iron
chest, a grindstone, a few spears and a halberd. Carlsen relates that round the house
were found several large casks which had been provided with iron hoops, but the staves
as well as the hoops were so rotten that no part of them could be brought home. Before
Captain Carlsen left the place he erected in the neighbourhood of the house a cairn,
on which he placed a pole 10 metres long. In the cairn was deposited a double tin
case, containing a written account of his having been there on the 13th of September
1871, and of his having found articles belonging to the men of the Dutch expedition
under Barendsz, who had wintered there in the years 1596–97.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Such are the particulars about the discovery of the relics in the winter-house of
Novaya Zemlya.
</p>
<p>Up to February 1872, the public in Holland remained ignorant of the discovery of the
winter quarters of Barendsz, and that several objects, including a few books written
in the Dutch language, were brought home. This news, however, when spread, caused
a general sensation throughout the Netherlands, and measures were immediately taken
by the Government to obtain possession of these interesting relics. Information was
at once obtained as to their whereabouts, and it became known that they were already
in the possession of Mr. Ellis C. Lister Kay, who, travelling as an English tourist
in Norway, and being by chance at Hammerfest on the arrival of Carlsen, had immediately
bought them. Upon learning the interest which the Netherlands Government took in these
relics, Mr. Kay kindly gave them <span class="pageNum" id="pblii">[<a href="#pblii">lii</a>]</span>up, accepting only the same amount as he had given to obtain possession of them. This
courteous behaviour of Mr. Kay restored to the native land of the great explorer these
precious relics, which had remained hidden for nearly three centuries. They were afterwards
deposited in the model-room of the Naval Department at the Hague, where a model-house,
having an open front, has been constructed for their reception. This is an exact imitation
of the original at Novaya Zemlya. There these old and touching memorials of a noble
achievement have found a final resting-place in the worthy company of a number of
ancient objects, which each for itself silently points to some one of the many glorious
pages in the annals of Dutch naval history. To demonstrate that these objects found
by Captain Carlsen originally appertained to Barendsz and his companions, Mr. De Jonge
says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The relics bear in themselves the undeniable proof—1st, that they have belonged to
Dutch navigators; and 2nd, that they must belong to the last period of the 16th century,
and especially to that part included between 1592 and 1598, as I will prove out of
the following description of the objects:—
</p>
<p>“1. An iron frame on four iron feet, with three iron cross bars of which one is moveable
(a kind of iron trivet), was found by Captain Carlsen in the centre of the house of
Barendsz and Heemskerck, exactly resembling that iron frame which we see also represented
in the centre of the house in the old illustration by Levinus Hulsius in 1598.
</p>
<p>“2. A round copper cooking pan with handle. Found standing on the iron frames.
</p>
<p>“3. A ditto larger one, with broken handle, the pan on <span class="pageNum" id="pbliii">[<a href="#pbliii">liii</a>]</span>the upper side a little dinted. Found standing on the same place.
</p>
<p>“4. Three copper bands, remains most likely of porringers, found close to the three
objects above alluded to.
</p>
<p>“5. A fragment of a copper scoop with handle.
</p>
<p>“6. A round grindstone with iron axis.<span id="xd33e1221"></span>
</p>
<p>“7. Fragments of a chest with metal handle belonging to it, besides four other pieces
of iron. An iron box made to fit within the chest, in order therein to deposit valuables.
All these things were half crumbled away.
</p>
<p>“8. The iron cover of the chest (spoken of in No. 7), with intricate lock-work.
</p>
<p>“9. An iron crow-bar, bent in the middle, at the lower end a point, the upper end
formed like the tail of a swallow. The part which opens out is worn in a circular
shape, having in all probability served as a rest for the axis of a spit.
</p>
<p>“10. The sieve of a copper scummer.
</p>
<p>“11. A tin plate.
</p>
<p>“12. An iron bar in two pieces. This bar was sawn across at Hammerfest, as it was
presumed to be a gun-barrel.
</p>
<p>“13. Iron striker or sledge-hammer; the handle is broken.
</p>
<p>“14. A borer or auger, with auger-bit. Such an auger is represented in the illustration,
‘How made ready to sail back to Holland’.
</p>
<p>“15. A ditto, one with larger auger-bit.
</p>
<p>“16. Three gauges, without handles.
</p>
<p>“17. A large chisel, with a wooden handle.
</p>
<p>“18. An adze, of which the handle was broken.
</p>
<p>“19. A caulking-iron.
</p>
<p>“20. A borer, with the handle broken, and two other boring irons.
</p>
<p>“21. Seven iron files, of different dimensions.
</p>
<p>“22. A stone to whet tools.
</p>
<p>“23. Two iron pairs of compasses.
</p>
<p>“24. A broken pocket-knife or cutlass, with horn handle.
</p>
<p>“25. A copper tap of a wine or beer cask. Excellently preserved.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbliv">[<a href="#pbliv">liv</a>]</span></p>
<p>“26. A wooden siphon of a beer or vinegar cask.
</p>
<p>“27. A wooden trencher, painted red.
</p>
<p>“28. An old Dutch earthenware jar, in which there was still a little grease. (See
a similar jug in the illustration, ‘How we were wrecked, and with great danger had
to betake ourselves to the ice’.)
</p>
<p>“29. A tin tankard, with lid and handle. Decayed.
</p>
<p>“30. The lower half of another tankard.
</p>
<p>“31. Three tin spoons, of which one is broken. Of the form used in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.
</p>
<p>“32. The inner works of a lock.
</p>
<p>“33. A ditto, larger one, with a part of the key.
</p>
<p>“34. An iron weight, of 8 lbs.
</p>
<p>“35. A padlock.
</p>
<p>“36. Two leathern shoes or slippers. These shoes are too small for a full-grown man.
They must consequently have belonged to the ship’s boy, of whom there is mention in
the journal of De Veer, on the 19th of October, 1596.
</p>
<p>“37. Iron clock-work, in which are seven cog-wheels; the cover is of iron plates,
but partly rusted. The dial-plate is lost, but one of the hands is still present.
There is also a circular-shaped flexible piece of iron, quite rusted, probably the
spring. In the journal of Gerrit de Veer, at the date of 27th of October, he makes
mention, on that day: ‘They set up the dial and made the clock strike.’ On the 3rd
of December, 1596, ‘The clock was frozen and might not go, although we hung more weight
on it than before’. This clock agrees in form almost perfectly with the clock drawn
in the illustration of Hulsius. A similar clock is also given in the work entitled:
‘<span lang="fr">Le Moyen-âge et la Renaissance<span id="xd33e1262"></span>, par P. Lacroix et F. Serré, Paris, 1851</span>’. In the article ‘<span lang="fr">Corporations de Métier<span id="xd33e1267"></span>, par A. Monteil et Rabutanz<span class="corr" id="xd33e1269" title="Not in source">’</span></span>, is found a drawing: ‘<span lang="fr">L’horloger, facsimilé de planche dessinée et gravée, par Jost Ammon</span>’. This drawing represents a clock of similar construction to that found in Novaya
Zemlya. This print, in ‘<span lang="fr">Le Moyen-âge</span>’, seems to have been copied out of the work of Hartin Schopperus, entitled ‘<span lang="la">Panoplia, <span class="pageNum" id="pblv">[<a href="#pblv">lv</a>]</span>Omnium illiberalium, mechanicarum aut sedentariarum artium genera continens; Cum figuris
a Jost Ammon. Francofurti, 1568</span>’. Hence we come to the conclusion that the clock, with its weight, found at Novaya
Zemlya, belongs, as is proved by its construction, to work of the sixteenth century.
The application of the pendulum took place later, in 1658.
</p>
<p>“38. One of the weights belonging to the clock.
</p>
<p>“39. A metal clock. This clock, with four perches, stood probably upon the mechanism
described in No. 37.
</p>
<p>“40. A little iron hammer, without doubt part of the striking apparatus.
</p>
<p>“41. Three copper scales of a balance, having served for weighing medicines. According
to the journal of Mr. G. de Veer, ‘a barber-surgeon joined the crew of Heemskerck
and Barendsz’.
</p>
<p>“42. A six-holed German flute, of beechwood, but without the mouth-piece. It is broken
at the end.
</p>
<p>“43. A part of an instrument, of which one end is constructed of wood. In this end
is found a groove, a round opening, and a wooden tongue. To this wooden tongue is
fastened a copper one, opening out in three parts, and ending in a point. It is difficult
to say to what instrument this belonged; but it is not quite improbable that it has
been fastened on the axis of a globe, in order to prick the chart. Globes and plain
charts were used at this period for want of Mercator’s projection.
</p>
<p>“44. A wooden compass card, with moveable wooden hand, in the centre of which is found
a round opening for the point of the axis.
</p>
<p>“45. A wooden rectangle, with three circular segments one within the other, and subtending
the rectangle. The longer arm is broken in three pieces.
</p>
<p>“46. A semi-circular copper plate, whose case is curved in such a manner as to form
a parallel. Through the middle of the plate runs a meridian, having in its centre
a small screw, which was formerly moveable, but now fixed by rust. <span class="pageNum" id="pblvi">[<a href="#pblvi">lvi</a>]</span>On the left or on the west side of the meridian are drawn nine arcs, having their
centre in the point of intersection of the meridian and parallel. On these arcs the
degrees are indicated by ciphers, and between these arcs are found the Dutch words:
<span lang="nl">Wassende Noordoostersche, Afgaande Noordoostersche, Wassende Noordwestersche</span>, etc. It is difficult to say in what manner this instrument was used, but probably
it is an instrument that has served for examining and determining the variations of
the compass. If I dare express my opinion, I should say, that this is the instrument
which Plancius, the master of Barendsz, invented to calculate the longitude at sea.
Plancius was at that time much occupied with his theory of determining the longitude
at sea, by means of the variation of the needle. For farther details see the work
entitled: ‘Rise of the Dutch power in the East Indies,’ volume i, p. 86. According
to Plancius there existed 8 meridians, under 4 of which there was no variation, and
under the 4 others a maximum variation took place. Calculating upon these data Plancius
imagined that the true longitude could be found. He therefore adapted a copper plate
to the astrolabe employed at that period, and the object found by Carlsen is probably
this very copper plate, the only one now extant.

</p>
<p>“47. The handle of a sword beautifully formed. A similar handle is represented on
drawing 61, letter B in the work of Mr. D<span class="corr" id="xd33e1304" title="Not in source">.</span> <span class="corr" id="xd33e1306" title="Source: vander">van der</span> Kellen, Jr., entitled: ‘Antiquities of the Netherlands.’
</p>
<p>“48. A sword with ditto handle.
</p>
<p>“49. The point of a sword.
</p>
<p>“50. A part of a spear, with iron spearhead.
</p>
<p>“51. Ditto head without wood.
</p>
<p>“52. The point of a halberd. A nearly equiform halberd is represented in the illustration.
‘The exact manner of the house wherein we wintered’.
</p>
<p>“53. The barrel of a heavy musket or matchlock, with breach-pin, pan, matchstick,
a sight on the fore part of the barrel. In the work ‘<span lang="fr">Le Moyen-âge et la Renaissance</span>’, <span class="pageNum" id="pblvii">[<a href="#pblvii">lvii</a>]</span>par P. Lacroix<span id="xd33e1321"></span> et F. Seré, Paris, 1851, T. iv. in the article ‘<span lang="fr">Armurerie, armes à feu portatives</span>’, folio xxiii, by F. de Saulcy, is the following passage: ‘<span lang="fr">L’arquebuse à mêche resta pendant longtemps l’arme ordinaire d’une partie de l’infanterie;
seulement après en avoir diminué le poids on lui donna le nom de mousquet, et le mousquet
à mêche était encore en usage dans les armées de Louis XIII</span>’. To this kind of firearm belongs the barrel spoken of under No. 53. The mechanism,
with which the match was brought on the panpowder was called ‘<span lang="fr">le serpentin</span>’. ‘<span lang="fr">Le serpentin</span>’, says de Saulcy, ‘<span lang="fr">exigeait que le soldat eût constamment sur lui une mêche allumée, ou le moyen de faire
du feu: il fallait en outre compasser la mêche, etc. Pour remédier à cet inconvénient
on inventa les platines à rouet, qui furent employées d’abord en Allemagne et fabriquées,
dit on, pour la première fois en 1517 à Neuremberg. Dans la platine à rouet la complication
du mécanisme avait trop d’inconvénients, pour qu’on ne cherchât pas à le perfectionner.
Les Espagnols y parurent les premiers. La platine espagnole, appelée souvent platine
de miquelet, présentait au dehors un ressort qui pressait à l’extrémité de sa branche
mobile sur un bras du chien, l’autre bras de cette pièce lorsqu’on mettait le chien
au bandé appuyait contre une broche, sortant de l’intérieur et traversant le corps
de la platine. On retirait cette broche et le ressort poussait le chien, qui n’était
plus retenu, et la pierre frappait sur un plan d’acier cannelé, qui faisait corps
avec le couvercle du bassinet. Le choc de la pierre sur les cannelures de l’acier
produisait le feu</span>’. The matchlock under No. 57 seems to be a fragment of such a platine de miquelet.
</p>
<p>“54. The barrel of a gun of smaller calibre, with three sights.
</p>
<p>“55. Ditto.
</p>
<p>“56. Ditto (broken).
</p>
<p>“57. A part of a matchlock, with cock, and flint-stones.
</p>
<p>“58. Nineteen copper powder horns, some of them covered with leather, and some still
full of powder. These horns were suspended to a shoulder belt.
<span class="pageNum" id="pblviii">[<a href="#pblviii">lviii</a>]</span></p>
<p>“59. An iron cannon ball.
</p>
<p>“60. A tin bracket pitcher, beautifully engraved. Style Renaissance. Probably it belonged
to the merchandise of which, according to de Veer, the ship’s cargo partly consisted.
The pitcher is in a perfect state of preservation.
</p>
<p>“61. The upper half of another pitcher.
</p>
<p>“62. Five tin candlesticks on pedestals, beautifully formed, as they were used in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Probably merchandise.
</p>
<p>“63. Five ditto, of another form, of which three are broken. Merchandise.
</p>
<p>“64. Thirteen ditto, but again of another and smaller form; in three of them the upper
part is wanting.
</p>
<p>“65. Two tin boxes, each divided into four compartments, of which the lower part,
if you turn it, can be used as a drinking cup, the centre as a saltcellar, whilst
the upper part is fit for a pepper box, the top of which unscrews.
</p>
<p>“66. Two ditto, of which only the drinking cups and the upper part of the pepper box
have been preserved.
</p>
<p>“67. Two ditto, of which only the lower part of the drinking cups has been preserved.
</p>
<p>“68. A tin medallion, on which is represented: ‘Time that uplifts truth from the earth’,
and on which a marginal inscription is to be read: ‘<span lang="la">Abstrusam. Tenebris. Tempus. Me Educit. Tu Auras. H. G.</span> (Henry or Hurbert Goltzius)’. Inside the margin is found: ‘<span lang="la">Veritas filia temporis</span>’. Probably also an object of merchandise. A description of similar medals is found
in the Dutch work of C. Leemans, in ‘<span lang="nl">de Verslagen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen</span>’.
</p>
<p>“69. A ditto medallion in a small wooden frame, representing a woman seated, holding
in her right hand a cross, and in her left a chalice or goblet, from which a flame
like light arises. Behind her lies one of the tables of the law. A symbol of religion,
or of the New Testament.
</p>
<p>“70. Two ditto medallions, in wooden frames, representing a woman with a child in
her lap, and another in her <span class="pageNum" id="pblix">[<a href="#pblix">lix</a>]</span>arms. A third child seeks refuge near her; this is probably a symbol of Mercy.
</p>
<p>“71. Three copper parts of objects, the original destination of which is uncertain.
</p>
<p>“72. Two wooden stoppers, either belaying pins, which are used on small ships to fasten
ropes, or pieces of furniture. These objects have been erroneously taken by Captain
Carlsen for drumsticks.
</p>
<p>“73. Nine buttons, and the stopper of a tin bottle.
</p>
<p>“74. The haft of a knife, and another object of carved wood. Not Dutch work, but apparently
of Norwegian or Russian origin. Barendsz or one of his companions might have obtained
these objects on the former expeditions. Moreover the trade with Archangel gave them
opportunities of buying Russian or Norwegian articles.
</p>
<p>“75. A great number of prints from copper engravings. These prints have been completely
frozen together, and whilst in that state a beam or other part of the dwelling has
fallen upon them, for they seem to have been broken whilst in congealed condition,
and a thaw has reduced them to a compact mass. The prints are well executed, but the
paper having become too weak, only some of the engravings have been removed, and those
in a torn condition. Some of them represent Roman heroes, by Goltzius; the ‘Defenders
of Harlem’, by Goltzius. 1857, subscribed Londerseel; ‘Paradise’, by Spranger, subscribed
Bosscher; ‘Pallas, Juno, and Venus in presence of Paris<span class="corr" id="xd33e1379" title="Not in source">’</span>, with ‘Bosscher excudit’. Scenes taken from the Bible, such as ‘The meeting of Esau
and Jacob’, ‘Tobias’, etc. Also representations of Asiatic or Persian horsemen, etc.;
a large drawing, showing a reposing lion, with the monogram HTR. (The <i>H</i> and <i>R</i> written together, and the <i>T</i> interlaced in the <i>H</i>). The manner of engraving the names of the engravers proves that all these must have
been the work of the sixteenth century. It may seem strange that Arctic navigators
had prints or engravings on board, but it is not at all so, for Heemskerck and Barendsz
intended to go as far as China, when they <span class="pageNum" id="pblx">[<a href="#pblx">lx</a>]</span>sailed to the North-East. For that purpose they had merchandise on board, and prints
or engravings were often used as such. This had also been the case on the first voyage
to the East Indies. On a list of goods and merchandise left at Patani, in Siam, in
1602, a great number of drawings by de Gheyn, Goltzius, Brengel, etc., are to be found,
and among these, facsimiles of those discovered at Novaya Zemlya, namely, ‘The Three
Goddesses’, ‘The Roman heroes’, etc.
</p>
<p>“76. A folio book bound in leather, and with copper clasps, but half the binding has
mouldered away. The beginning and the end of this book, as well as the edges, are
much decayed, and the title of the first volume is quite obliterated. The book is
divided into two parts; the first volume, of which the title is obliterated, has proved
to be, after comparison with another specimen of this work, ‘<span lang="nl">Die Cronycke van Hollant, Zeeland ende Vrieslant, tot den jare 1517, etc., tot Delft,
by Aelbert Hendricus, wonnende op ’t Meretveld, Anno 1585</span>’.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1398src" href="#xd33e1398" title="Go to note 23.">23</a> The second volume, of which the title is intact, runs: ‘Short and true account of
the Government, and the most remarkable facts that occurred in the country of Holland,
Zeeland, and Friesland, by Albert Hendriksz, anno 1585’.
</p>
<p>“77. A book in quarto (the edges of which are much decayed), entitled: ‘The Navigation,
or the Art of Sailing, by the excellent pilote, Pieter de Medina, a Spaniard, etc<span class="corr" id="xd33e1406" title="Not in source">.</span>; with still another new Instruction on the Principal Points of Navigation, by Michel
Coignet. ’t Hantwerpen, anno 1580’. At the bottom of the page, where the fifth chapter
of the new instruction of Coignet begins, opposite to a copy of the Astrolabe (the
number of the page is worn out), there is written in the old Dutch, ‘<span lang="nl">… y myn Jan Aerjanss … Pieter Janss … y (of 17) April ghinghen vij van … (lyberen
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxi">[<a href="#pblxi">lxi</a>]</span>herte?)</span>’. The two last words are almost illegible. Gerrit de Veer gives, at the end of his
recital, the names of those who returned from Novaya Zemlya. Among these, the names
of <i>Jan Aerjanss</i> and <i>Pieter Janss</i> are not to be found. These were, most likely, the names of two of the missing crew
of whom the names are not mentioned. Of the seventeen persons who set out, only twelve
returned safely to the Netherlands. A new translation, by Mr. Martin Everart Brug,
of the work of Medina, had been published in 1598, by Cornelis Claesz, at Amsterdam,
with Coignet’s new instructions. As the copy found at Novaya Zemlya is a publication
of 1580, it follows, as a matter of course, that the Dutch navigators who had left
this copy, dated 1580, at Novaya Zemlya, must have started before the year 1598, or
they would assuredly have taken the latest edition of so important a work, especially
when printed at Amsterdam, from whence they started.
</p>
<p>“78. A little book, with parchment cover, in octavo, having the form of a pocket-book,
entitled, ‘The History or Description of the great Empire of China’. This was first
written in Spanish by Juan Gonzales de Mendoza, monk of the Order of St. Augustin,
and then translated from the Italian into Dutch by Corn. Taemsz, and printed for Cornelis
Claesz, book-seller, living at the Gilt Bible, in North Street, Hoorn, by Jacob de
M——, printer, in the town of Alkmaar. The date of the edition of this copy cannot
be given with exactitude, by reason of the mouldering away of the lower part of the
title-page. The origin of the work can be deduced from the following facts: In the
address to the Good Willing Reader, <i>verso</i> of the title-page, is written that ‘this little book was edited after Jan Huyghen
van Linschoten had returned to the Netherlands, but somewhat before the publication
of the account of his voyage’. Jan Huyghen van Linschoten returned to Holland in the
autumn of 1592, and the account of his voyage was published by Cornelis Claesz in
1595. Thus the translation of Mendoza must have been published somewhere between <span class="pageNum" id="pblxii">[<a href="#pblxii">lxii</a>]</span>1592 and 1595. I even believe that we can fix the date of the publishing to be 1595;
for the copy found at Novaya Zemlya is exactly similar, both in form and type, to
another copy still extant, published in Amsterdam by Cornelis Claesz in 1595. The
edition of Amsterdam is exactly similar to the edition of Hoorn, except the title
and the first twelve pages of the preface, which in the edition of Amsterdam are of
the same purport, but printed in another type. The only difference between the two
works consists in the type of the preface.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>On the 17th of August, 1875, M. Gundersen, commander of the Norwegian schooner <i>Regina</i>, was the first after Carlsen who visited Barendsz’s Ice Harbour. In a chest, the
upper part of which was quite mouldered, he found an old journal, two charts, and
a grapnel with four flukes, three of which seemed to have been purposely broken off.
The charts, pasted upon sail-cloth, are much injured. The words “Germania inferior”
may be read on them. The journal has proved to be a manuscript Dutch translation of
the narrative of the English expedition of Pet and Jackman, 1580.

the position of Councillor of Amsterdam, when Gerrit de Veer undertook his voyage

</p>
<p>The three voyages undertaken by the Dutch, towards the close of the sixteenth century,
with a view to the discovery of a north-east passage to China, are deservedly placed
among the most remarkable exploits of that enterprising nation; while the ten months’
residence of the adventurous seamen at the furthest extremity of the inhospitable
region of Novaya Zemlya, within little more than fourteen degrees of the North Pole,
and their homeward voyage of upwards of seventeen hundred geographical miles in two
small open boats, are events full of romantic interest.
</p>
<p>The republication by the Hakluyt Society of the narrative of these three voyages,
is most appropriate at this particular juncture, when public attention is so painfully
absorbed by apprehensions as to the fate of Franklin and his companions. At all times
would this work be read with interest, as giving in plain and simple language, which
vouches for its truth, the first account of a forced winter residence in the Arctic
Regions, patiently and resolutely endured and successfully terminated; but at the
present moment it acquires a far deeper importance from its representation—faint,
perhaps, and wholly inadequate to the reality—of the hardships which must have been
undergone by our missing countrymen; happy if some of them shall have survived, like
Gerrit de Veer, to tell the tale of their sufferings and of their final deliverance
from their long captivity.
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxiv">[<a href="#pblxiv">lxiv</a>]</span></p>
<p>In adverting to the causes which led to these three expeditions, it would be quite
superfluous to enter upon the general history of Arctic discovery. All that is requisite
for the proper elucidation of the present subject, is an investigation of the actual
state of our knowledge respecting the precise field of the labours of our Dutch navigators,
previously to the date of their adventurous undertaking.
</p>
<p>Three centuries have now elapsed since the first attempt was made to discover a north-east
passage to China and India. The circumstances under which this took place, cannot
be better detailed than in the words of Clement Adams, in his account of “the newe
Nauigation and discouerie of the kingdome of Muscouia, by the north-east, in the yeere
1553”, which is printed by Hakluyt in the first volume of his <i>Principal Navigations</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“At what time our marchants perceiued the commodities and wares of England to bee
in small request with the countreys and people about vs and neere vnto vs, and that
those marchandizes which strangers in the time and memorie of our auncesters did earnestly
seeke and desire, were nowe neglected and the price thereof abated, although by vs
carried to their owne portes, and all forreine marchandises in great accompt and their
prises wonderfully raised: certaine graue citizens of London, and men of great wisedome,
and carefull for the good of their countrey, began to thinke with themselves howe
this mischiefe might be remedied. Neither was a remedie (as it then appeared) wanting
to their desires, for the auoyding of so great an inconuenience: for, seeing that
the wealth of the Spaniards and Portingales, by the discouerie and search of newe
trades and countreys was marueilously increased, supposing the same to be a course
and meane for them also to obteine the like, they thereupon resolued upon a newe and
strange nauigation. And whereas at the same time one Sebastian Cabota,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1455src" href="#xd33e1455" title="Go to note 1.">1</a> a man in those dayes very renowned, happened to bee in London, they began first of
all to deale and consult diligently with him, and after much speech and conference
together, it was at last concluded that three shippes should bee prepared and furnished
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxv">[<a href="#pblxv">lxv</a>]</span>out, for the search and discouerie of the northerne part of the world, to open a way
and passage to our men for trauaile to newe and vnknowen kingdomes.
</p>
<p>“And whereas many things seemed necessary to bee regarded in this so hard and difficult
a matter, they first make choyse of certaine graue and wise persons, in maner of a
senate or companie, which should lay their heads together and giue their iudgements,
and prouide things requisite and profitable for all occasions: by this companie it
was thought expedient that a certaine summe of money should publiquely bee collected,
to serue for the furnishing of so many shippes. And lest any priuate man should bee
too much oppressed and charged, a course was taken, that euery man willing to be of
the societie should disburse the portion of twentie and five pounds a piece; so that
in short time by this meanes the summe of sixe thousand pounds being gathered, the
three shippes were bought, the most part whereof they prouided to be newly built and
trimmed.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1464src" href="#xd33e1464" title="Go to note 2.">2</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The three vessels thus fitted out sailed in company from Ratcliff on the 10th of May,
1553. On their arrival at Harwich, they were detained there some time; “yet at the
last with a good winde they hoysed vp saile, and committed themselues to the sea,
giuing their last adieu to their natiue country, which they knewe not whether they
should euer returne to see againe or not. Many of them looked oftentimes backe, and
could not refraine from teares, considering into what hazards they were to fall, and
what vncertainties of the sea they were to make triall of.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1469src" href="#xd33e1469" title="Go to note 3.">3</a>
</p>
<p>These gloomy forebodings were not long in finding their realization. In a violent
tempest off the coast of Norway, two of the vessels, the Bona Esperanza and Bona Confidentia,
in the former of which was Sir Hugh Willoughby, captain-general of the fleet, were
driven far out to sea, and at length put into a small haven on the coast of Lapland,
near the mouth of the river Warsina,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1475src" href="#xd33e1475" title="Go to note 4.">4</a> where the entire crews of <span class="pageNum" id="pblxvi">[<a href="#pblxvi">lxvi</a>]</span>both vessels, amounting in all to seventy souls, miserably perished from cold and
hunger.
</p>
<p>Before meeting with his untimely end, Willoughby, on the 14th of August, “descried
land, which land (he says, in a note found written in one of the two ships) we bare
with all, hoising out our boat to discover what land it might be; but the boat could
not come to land, the water was so shoale, where was very much ice also, but there
was no similitude of habitation; and this land lyeth from Seynam<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1490src" href="#xd33e1490" title="Go to note 5.">5</a> east and by north 160 leagues, being in latitude 72 degrees. Then we plyed to the
northward”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1493src" href="#xd33e1493" title="Go to note 6.">6</a> As the subject of Willoughby’s voyage has been discussed by Mr. Rundall in a recent
publication of the Hakluyt Society,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1496src" href="#xd33e1496" title="Go to note 7.">7</a> it is here unnecessary to say more than that, whatever may formerly have been the
notions of geographers as to the coast reached by our hapless countryman, and to which
the name of “Willoughby’s Land” was given, the almost universally received opinion
now is<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1501src" href="#xd33e1501" title="Go to note 8.">8</a> that it was that portion of the western coast of Novaya Zemlya, which is called by
Lütke the Goose Coast (<i lang="de">Gänseufer</i> in Erman’s Translation<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1510src" href="#xd33e1510" title="Go to note 9.">9</a>),—doubtless from the numbers of water-fowl found there,—and of which the North and
South Goose Capes (<i>Syevernuy Gusinuy Muis</i> and <i>Yuzhnuy Gusinuy Muis</i>) form the two extremities. Mr. Rundall is therefore fully justified in claiming for
Sir Hugh Willoughby, as he so earnestly does in his work just cited,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1517src" href="#xd33e1517" title="Go to note 10.">10</a> “the credit of having been the first Englishman by whom the coast of Novaya Zemlya
was visited”; and as, further, Willoughby was not only the first Englishman, but also
the first European, who had ever been there, the rule and usual practice in regard
to new discoveries fairly warrants the application <span class="pageNum" id="pblxvii">[<a href="#pblxvii">lxvii</a>]</span>of the name of “Willoughby’s Land” to this “Goose Coast”, which our countryman was
thus the first to visit and make known to us.
</p>
<p>In thus attributing the discovery of Novaya Zemlya to Sir Hugh Willoughby, it is in
no wise intended to deny that that island—or chain of islands, as it may be more correctly
designated—was previously known to the inhabitants of the northern coasts of Russia.
The name itself,—<i>Novaya Zemlya</i>, which in the Russian language signifies “the New Country” or “Newfoundland”,—and
the fact that the early European navigators, both English and Dutch, who followed
in Willoughby’s footsteps, met with native vessels on the coast, from the crews of
which they learned their way and obtained various particulars of local information,
are quite sufficient to establish the priority of the Russians.
</p>
<p>Still, the discovery of a country, like any other discovery or invention in science
or the arts, dates properly from the time when the knowledge of that discovery is
first recorded and publicly communicated to the civilised world; and in this sense
even the Russian admiral Lütke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1529src" href="#xd33e1529" title="Go to note 11.">11</a> the great explorer of Novaya Zemlya in modern times, does not hesitate to acknowledge,
that, owing to the absence of all written records bearing on the subject, his countrymen
cannot pretend to lay claim to the “discovery” of Novaya Zemlya.
</p>
<p>Richard Chancellor, pilot-major of Willoughby’s fleet, was far more fortunate than
his hapless chief. In the third vessel, the Edward Bonaventure, commanded by Stephen
Burrough, he succeeded in entering the Bay of St. Nicholas, since better known as
the White Sea, and on the 24th of August, 1553, reached in safety the western mouth
of the river Dwina, whence he proceeded overland to the court of the Emperor of Muscovy
or Russia, at Moscow. The result was the foundation of the commercial and political
relations <span class="pageNum" id="pblxviii">[<a href="#pblxviii">lxviii</a>]</span>between England and Russia, which have subsisted, with but brief interruptions, till
the present day.
</p>
<p>Shortly after Chancellor had brought his section of Willoughby’s expedition to so
successful an issue, the company of merchant-adventurers, by whom the three ships
had been fitted out, received a charter of incorporation, bearing date February 6th,
1 and 2 Ph. and Mar. (1554–5); and subsequently, in the eighth year of Queen Elizabeth
(1566), they obtained an Act of Parliament, in which they are styled “the Fellowship
of English Merchants for Discovery of New Trades”; a title under which they still
continue incorporated, though they are better known by the designation of the “Muscovy”
or “Russia Company”.
</p>
<p>It is not here the place to discuss the general proceedings of the Russia Company,
important though they be, and highly deserving of being made the subject of special
investigation. All that we have to do is to notice the expeditions which were undertaken
under the auspices of that company, for the purpose of exploring the seas bounding
the Russian Empire on the north, with a view to the discovery of a north-east passage
to China.
</p>
<p>Of these expeditions, the first was that of Stephen Burrough, who had in 1553 been
the master of Richard Chancellor’s ship, the Edward Bonaventure, and who now, in 1556,
was despatched in the pinnace Searchthrift to make discovery towards the river Ob.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1542src" href="#xd33e1542" title="Go to note 12.">12</a>
</p>
<p>Leaving Gravesend on the 23rd of April of the latter year, Burrough, on the 23rd of
May, passed the North Cape, which he had so named on his first voyage, and on the
9th of June reached Kola, where he fell in with several small Russian vessels (<i>lodji</i>), all “bound to Pechora, a fishing for salmons and morses”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1552src" href="#xd33e1552" title="Go to note 13.">13</a> The master of one of these boats, named Gabriel, rendered good service to Burrough,
who is <span class="pageNum" id="pblxix">[<a href="#pblxix">lxix</a>]</span>diffuse in his praise of Gabriel’s conduct, as contrasted with that of other Russian
seamen with whom he had to do.
</p>
<p>In the company of these native boats Burrough passed by Svyátoi Nos, called by him
Cape St. John; Kanin Nos (Caninoz); the island of Kolguev, by mistake called in his
journal <i>D</i>olgoieue; then the second Svyátoi Nos, and so to “the dangerous barre of Pechora”.
Passing still onwards, he, on St. James’s day, July 25th, “spied certain islands”,
lying to the south of Novaya Zemlya, under one of which he anchored, naming it “St.
James his Island”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1562src" href="#xd33e1562" title="Go to note 14.">14</a> and making its latitude to be 70° 42′ N., which according to Lütke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1565src" href="#xd33e1565" title="Go to note 15.">15</a> is about 10′ too far north. The next day they “plyed to the westwards alongst the
shoare” of the southern extremity of Novaya Zemlya, where they met with another small
native vessel, the master of which, named Loshak, told them that they were past the
way which should bring them to the Ob;—that the land by which they were was “called
Noua Zembla, that is to say, the New Land;<span class="corr" id="xd33e1568" title="Not in source">”</span>—and that “in this Noua Zembla is the highest mountaine in the worlde, as he thought,
and that Camen Bolshay,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1570src" href="#xd33e1570" title="Go to note 16.">16</a> which is on the maine of Pechora, is not to be compared to this mountaine; but” (adds
Burrough cautiously) “I saw it not”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1576src" href="#xd33e1576" title="Go to note 17.">17</a>
</p>
<p>On the 31st of July, Burrough was “at an anker among the islands of Vaigats”; on one
of which islands he went on shore the following day. On Monday, the 3rd of August,
he continues: “We weyed and went roome with another island, which was five leagues
east-north-east from us; and there I met againe with Loshak, and went on shore with
him, and hee brought me to a heap of the Samoeds idols, which were in number aboue
300, the worst and the most unartificiall worke that ever I saw. The eyes and mouthes
of sundrie of them were bloodie; they had the shape of men, <span class="pageNum" id="pblxx">[<a href="#pblxx">lxx</a>]</span>women, and children, very grosly wrought; and that which they had made for other parts
was also sprinckled with blood. Some of their idols were an olde sticke, with two
or three notches made with a knife in it. I saw much of the footing of the sayd Samoeds,
and of the sleds that they ride in.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1583src" href="#xd33e1583" title="Go to note 18.">18</a>
</p>
<p>These particulars clearly prove that the spot thus described by Burrough is Bolvánovsky
Nos (Image Cape), at the north-eastern extremity of the island of Vaigats, in 70°
29′ N. lat., which place, according to Lütke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1588src" href="#xd33e1588" title="Go to note 19.">19</a> was visited by Ivanov in 1824, and found to be in precisely the same state as represented
by its English discoverer. There is a second cape of the same name at the south-eastern
extremity of Vaigats Island, in 69° 40′ N. lat., which is the <i lang="nl">Afgodenhoeck</i> (Idol Cape) of Linschoten and the <i lang="nl">Beeldthoeck</i> (Image Cape) of De Veer, and which is described by the latter in his account of their
second voyage, at pages 53 and 60 of the present volume. Lütke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1597src" href="#xd33e1597" title="Go to note 20.">20</a> erroneously identifies this latter cape with the one discovered by Burrough; but
this is evidently a mere oversight, as the two capes of the same name are distinctly
laid down in his chart.
</p>
<p>On the 5th of August, fearing to be hemmed in by the ice, which approached his ship
in immense masses, Burrough returned westwards, and then southwards; and on the 22nd
of the same month, on account of the north and north-easterly winds, the great quantity
of ice, and the advanced season of the year, he determined on not attempting to proceed
further to the east, but returned round Kanin Nos into the White Sea, and so to Kholmogorui
(Colmogro), the Russian port on the Dwina previously to the foundation of Archangelsk,—Archangel,
or Novo-Kholmogorui, as it was at first called,—where he arrived on the 11th of September.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1602src" href="#xd33e1602" title="Go to note 21.">21</a>
</p>
<p>The passage by which Burrough thus sailed between <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxi">[<a href="#pblxxi">lxxi</a>]</span>Novaya Zemlya and Vaigats into the Sea of Kara, is that which by the Russians is called
Karskoi Vorota—the Kara Gate or Strait; and as he was the first navigator who is recorded
to have been there, he must be regarded as the “discoverer” of that Strait. And that
he was so considered by his contemporaries is established by the fact, that, in the
instructions given by the Russia Company, in 1580, to Pet and Jackman,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1609src" href="#xd33e1609" title="Go to note 22.">22</a> that entrance into the Sea of Kara is actually denominated “Burrough’s Strait”.
</p>
<p>For several years after Stephen Burrough’s voyage in the Searchthrift, the Russia
Company appear to have directed their attention principally to the trade with the
White Sea, and thence, overland, with the interior of the continent both in Europe
and in Asia. Still, it must not be imagined that they at all abandoned the idea of
a north-east passage to China. On the contrary, there is evidence in the instructions
given by them on the fitting out of two expeditions, at intervals of twelve years
each, that the subject was not lost sight of by them, and that they neglected no means
of obtaining information, with a view to the eventual realisation of the scheme which
was their principal object in the original formation of the company.
</p>
<p>The former of these two expeditions was in the year 1568, when James Bassendine, James
Woodcocke, and Richard Browne were appointed to undertake a voyage of discovery along
the northern coast of Russia, “from the river Pechora to the eastwards”. Of this undertaking
no memorial appears to be extant, except the “Commission” issued to the adventurers;
so that it is impossible to say what its success was. But the instructions contained
in that Commission are in themselves of so interesting a character, as showing in
a precise and definite form the extent of the knowledge of the Arctic Ocean to the
east of the White Sea, possessed by the English at a date mounting up to nearly three
centuries <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxii">[<a href="#pblxxii">lxxii</a>]</span>from the present time, that no apology will be necessary for here reprinting it from
the pages of Hakluyt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1618src" href="#xd33e1618" title="Go to note 23.">23</a> It must be premised that the date attributed by that author to this document is 1588;
which is, however, clearly a misprint. For, in the first place, it was in 1568 (not

<p class="first hangIndent"><span class="sc">A Commission</span> <i>given by vs, Thomas Randolfe, ambassadour for the Queenes Maiestie in Russia, and
Thomas Bannister, etc., vnto Iames Bassendine, Iames Woodcocke, and Richard Browne;
the which Bassendine, Woodcocke, and Browne we appoint ioyntly together, and aiders
the one of them to the other, in a voyage of discouery to be made (by the grace of
God) by them, for searching of the sea and border of the coast, from the riuer Pechora
to the eastwards, as hereafter followeth. Anno 1568, the first of August.</i>
</p>
<p>Imprimis, when your barke with all furniture is ready, you shall at the beginning
of the yere (assoone as you possibly may) make your repaire to the easterne part of
the riuer Pechora, where is an island called Dolgoieue, and from thence you shall
passe to the eastwards alongst by the sea coast of Hugorie, or the maine land of Pechora;
and sailing alongst by the same coast, you shall passe within seuen leagues of the
island Vaigats, which is in the straight, almost halfe way from the coast of Hugorie
unto the coast of Noua Zembla; <i>which island Vaigats and Noua Zembla you shall finde <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxiii">[<a href="#pblxxiii">lxxiii</a>]</span>noted in your plat, therefore you shall not need to discouer it</i>, but proceed on alongst the coast of Hugory towards the river Obba.
</p>
<p>There is a bay betweene the sayd Vaigats and the river Obba, that doth bite to the
southwards into the land of Hugory, in which bay are two small riuers, the one called
Cara Reca, the other Naramsy, as in the paper of notes which are giuen to you herewith
may appeare: in the which bay you shall not need to spend any time for searching of
it, but to direct your course to the river Ob (if otherwise you be not constrained
to keepe alongst the shore); and when you come to the river Ob, you shall not enter
into it, but passe ouer into the easterne part of the mouth of the sayd riuer.
</p>
<p>And when you are at the easterne part of the mouth of Obba Reca, you shall from thence
passe to the eastwards, alongst by the border of the sayd coast, describing the same
in such perfect order as you can best do it. You shall not leaue the sayd coast or
border of the land, but passe alongst by it, at least in sight of the same, untill
you haue sailed by it so farre to the eastwards, and the time of the yeere [be] so
farre spent, that you doe thinke it time for you to returne with your barke to winter,
which trauell may well be 300 or 400 leagues to the eastwards of the Ob, if the sea
doe reach so farre, as our hope is it doth; but and if you finde not the said coast
and sea to trend so farre to the eastwards, yet you shall not leaue the coast at any
time, but proceed alongst by it, as it doth lie, leauing no part of it vnsearched
or [un-]seene, unlesse it be some bay or river, that you doe certeinly know by the
report of the people that you shall finde in those borders, or els some certeine tokens
whereby you of your selues may iudge it to be so. For our hope is that the said border
of land and sea doth, in short space after you passe the Ob, incline east, and so
to the southwards. And therefore we would haue no part of the land of your starreboord
side, as you proceed in your discouery, to be left vndiscouered.
</p>
<p>But and if the said border of land do not incline so to the eastwards as we presuppose
it, but that it doe proue to incline and trend to the northwards, and so ioyne with
Noua Zembla, making the sea from Vaigats to the eastwarde but a bay; yet we will that
you do keepe alongst by the said coast, and so bring us certaine report of that forme
and maner of the same bay.
</p>
<p>And if it doe so proue to be a bay, and that you have passed round about the same,
and so by the trending of the land come backe vnto that part of Noua Zembla that is
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxxiv">[<a href="#pblxxiv">lxxiv</a>]</span>against Vaigats, whereas you may from that see the said island Vaigats; if the time
of the yeere will permit you, you shall from thence passe alongst by the said border
and coast of Noua Zembla to the westwards, and so <i>to search whether that part of Noua Zembla doe ioyne with the land that Sir Hugh Willoughbie
discouered in anno ’53, and is in 72 degrees and from that part of Noua Zembla 120
leagues to the westwards</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1659src" href="#xd33e1659" title="Go to note 27.">27</a> as your plat doeth shew it unto you; and if you doe finde that land to ioyne with
Noua Zembla, when you come to it, you shall proceed further along the same coast,
if the time of the yere will permit it, and that you doe thinke there will be sufficient
time for you to returne back with your barke to winter, either at Pechora or in Russia,
at your discretion; for we refer the same to your good iudgements, trusting that you
will lose no time that may further your knowledge in this voyage.
</p>
<p>Note you, it was the 20 of August, ’56, yer<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1666src" href="#xd33e1666" title="Go to note 28.">28</a> the Serchthrift began to returne backe from her discouerie, to winter in Russia;
and then she came from the island Vaigats, being forcibly driuen from thence with
an easterly winde and yce, and so she came into the riuer Dwina, and arriued at Colmogro
the 11 of September, ’56. If the yce had not bene so much that yere as it was in the
streights on both sides of the island Vaigats, they in the said pinnesse would that
yeere haue discouered the parts that you are now sent to seeke; which thing (if it
had pleased God) might haue bene done then; but God hath reserued it for some other.
Which discouerie, if it may be made by you, it shall not only proue profitable vnto
you, but it will also purchase perpetuall fame and renowne both to you and our countrey.
And thus, not doubting of your willing desires and forwardnesse towards the same,
we pray God to blesse you with a lucky beginning, fortunate successe, and happily
to end the same. Amen.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>As has already been stated, the results of this expedition are not known. We may,
therefore, pass to the consideration of the voyage of Arthur Pet and Charles Jackman
in the <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxv">[<a href="#pblxxv">lxxv</a>]</span>year 1580. For this undertaking written instructions were in like manner given by
the Russia Company, which have also been preserved by Hakluyt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1674src" href="#xd33e1674" title="Go to note 29.">29</a> But as these instructions correspond in many respects with those given to Bassendine
and his companions, it is here unnecessary to cite more from them than some few passages
requiring particular notice.
</p>
<p>The Commission from the Russia Company to Pet and Jackman was “for a voyage by them
to be made, by God’s grace, for search and discoueries of a passage by sea <i>by Borough’s Streights</i> and the island Vaigats, eastwards to the countries or dominions of the mightie prince,
the emperour of Cathay, and in the same unto the cities of Cambalu and Quinsay, or
to either of them”. And for that purpose they were directed to “saile from this river
of Thames to the coast of Finmarke, to the North Cape there, or to the Wardhouse”;
and from thence, continued their instructions, “direct your course to haue sight of
Willoughbies Land, and from it passe alongst to the Noua Zemla, keeping the same landes
alwayes in your sight on your larboord sides (if conueniently you may), to the ende
you may discouer whether the same Willoughbies Land be continent and firme land with
Noua Zemla or not; notwithstanding we would not haue you to entangle your selues in
any bay, or otherwise, so that it might hinder your speedy proceeding to the Island
Vaigats.
</p>
<p>“<i>And when you come to Vaigats, we would haue you to get sight of the maine land of
Samoeda</i>, which is ouer against the south part of the same island, and from thence, with God’s
permission, to <i>passe eastwards alongst the same coast, keeping it alwayes in your sight</i> (if conueniently you may) untill you come to the mouth of the riuer Ob: and when
you come unto it, passe ouer the said riuers mouth unto the border of land on the
east side of the same (without any <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxvi">[<a href="#pblxxvi">lxxvi</a>]</span>stay to bee made for searching inwardly in the same riuer), <i>and being in sight of the same easterly land, doe you, in Gods name, proceed alongst
by it from thence eastwards, keeping the same alwayes on your starboord side in sight</i>, if you may, and follow the tract of it, whether it incline southerly or northerly
(as at times it may do both), untill you come to the country of Cathay, or the dominion
of that mightie emperour.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1691src" href="#xd33e1691" title="Go to note 30.">30</a> But in case they should not be able to reach Cathay, they were directed to attempt
to ascend the river Ob; and if they should not succeed in this, they were then to
“returne backe <i>through Boroughs Streights</i>”, and “discouer and trie whether Willoughbies Land ioyne continent with Noua Zembla
or not”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1697src" href="#xd33e1697" title="Go to note 31.">31</a>
</p>
<p>In pursuance of these instructions, Pet and Jackman sailed from Harwich on the 31st
of May, 1580, in two small barks: namely, the George, of the burthen of forty tons,
under the command of the former, with a crew of nine men and a boy, and the William,
of twenty tons, commanded by the latter, with a crew of five men and a boy. On June
23rd they reached Wardhuus, which place they left in company on the 1st of the following
month. On the next day, however, as the William seemed “to be out of trie and sailed
very ill”, she “was willing to goe with Kegor”, where she might mend her steerage;
“whereupon Master Pet, not willing to go into harborough, said to Master Jackman that
if he thought himselfe not able to keepe the sea, he should doe as he thought best,
and that he in the meane time would beare with Willoughbies Land, for that it was
a parcel of our direction, and would meete him <i>at Veroue Ostroue, or Vaigats</i>”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1705src" href="#xd33e1705" title="Go to note 32.">32</a>
</p>
<p>The name of Veroue Ostroue, here given to the island of Vaigats, does not occur elsewhere.
It is manifestly Russian; though it is difficult to say what is its correct form,
and consequently <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxvii">[<a href="#pblxxvii">lxxvii</a>]</span>what its signification. As to the designation by which that island is generally known,
Witsen states, though without further explanation, that it was acquired from one Iwan
or Ian Waigats;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1713src" href="#xd33e1713" title="Go to note 33.">33</a> in commenting on which statement, Lütke says that the name should properly be written
Waigatsch, the Russian termination <i>tsch</i> having been changed by the Dutch into <i>tz</i>, in the same way as in Pi<i>tz</i>ora for Pe<i>tsch</i>ora, etc.<span id="xd33e1725"></span><a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1726src" href="#xd33e1726" title="Go to note 34.">34</a> The correctness of this criticism is, however, questionable. For, long before the
Dutch visited or knew anything of these parts, we find Englishmen,—who certainly had
no difficulty in pronouncing the sound <i>ch</i> (<i>tsch</i>), which is common to our language, and who in fact always wrote Pe<i>ch</i>ora (Petschora), and not, like the Dutch, Pi<i>tz</i>ora,—invariably writing not Vaiga<i>ch</i> (Vaiga<i>tsch</i>), but Vaiga<i>ts</i> or Vayga<i>tz</i>. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that Vaigats is the original pronunciation
of the name, and that the Russian form is merely a corruption.
</p>
<p>But to return to Pet, who after parting from Jackman continued his course eastwards,
apparently following in Willoughby’s track, till, on the 4th of July, he saw land
in latitude 71° 38′ north, being the coast of Novaya Zemlya, somewhere about the South
Goose Cape. Thence he coasted along the south-western end of Novaya Zemlya, keeping
the same in sight on the larboard side, as instructed to do, but not nearing it, on
account of ice and fog.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1748src" href="#xd33e1748" title="Go to note 35.">35</a> On the 10th of July, he approached the north-western extremity of Vaigatz Island,
and landed on a small island near the coast, where he took in wood and water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1751src" href="#xd33e1751" title="Go to note 36.">36</a> Here he remained till the 14th, when he got out with difficulty on account of the
ice, and “lay along the coast north-west, thinking it to be an island; but finding
no end in rowing so long”, he “supposed it to be the maine of Noua Zembla”, in which,
however, he was in error, and thereby missed the entrance into the Sea of <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxviii">[<a href="#pblxxviii">lxxviii</a>]</span>Kara by Burrough’s Strait. He now altered his course, and on the 15th “lay south south-west
with a flawne sheete, and so ranne all the same day”; and, after meeting with much
more ice, he on the 17th came into the “Bay of Pechora”. Thence, again taking an eastward
course, he on the 18th had sight of the southern extremity of Vaigatz, and on the
following day entered the passage running between that portion of the island and the
main land of the Samoede country; to which passage the Dutch, in the voyages which
form the subject of the following pages, gave the name of “the Straits of Nassau”,
and which the Russians call Yugorsky Schar, that is to say, the Ugorian Strait. Nevertheless,
if the first European explorer on record be entitled to the credit of his discovery,
this entrance into the Sea of Kara ought to bear the name of “Pet’s Strait,” in like
manner as the passage into that sea at the other extremity of Vaigatz Island received
the name of “Burrough’s Strait”.
</p>
<p>From the 19th till the 24th of July, Pet endeavoured to make his way eastwards in
accordance with his instructions, by keeping “the maine land of Samoeda” always in
sight on his starboard side, but was constantly impeded by the ice. At length he was
“constrained to put into the ice, to seeke some way to get to the northwards of it,
hoping to haue some cleare passage that way, but there was nothing but whole ice.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1759src" href="#xd33e1759" title="Go to note 37.">37</a>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jackman and his crew of five men and a boy, in their frail bark of twenty
tons, had gallantly followed after the George, and on the morning of the 25th July
the two vessels again joined company, the William being, however, in so disabled a
state when she reached her companion, as to require assistance from the latter. The
two vessels now “set saile to the northwardes, to seeke if they could finde any way
cleare to passe to the eastward; but the <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxix">[<a href="#pblxxix">lxxix</a>]</span>further they went that way, the more and thicker was the ice, so that they coulde
goe no further.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1766src" href="#xd33e1766" title="Go to note 38.">38</a>
</p>
<p>At length, seeing the impossibility of advancing either to the east or to the north,
on the 28th of July “Master Pet and Master Jackman did conferre together what was
best to be done, considering that the windes were good for us, and we not able to
passe for ice: they did agree to seeke to the land againe, and so to Vaygatz, and
then to conferre further. At 3 in the afternoone, we did warpe from one piece of ice
to another, to get from them if it were possible: here were pieces of ice so great
that we could not see beyond them out of the toppe.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1771src" href="#xd33e1771" title="Go to note 39.">39</a>
</p>
<p>It was only with the greatest difficulty and peril that they occasionally made their
way through the ice, in which for the most part they remained so enclosed “that they
could not stirre, labouring onely to defend the yce as it came upon them”; but at
length, on the 15th of August, <span class="corr" id="xd33e1778" title="Not in source">“</span>they entred into a cleare sea without yce, whereof they were most glad, and not without
cause, and gave God the praise”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1780src" href="#xd33e1780" title="Go to note 40.">40</a> On the day after, they say, “we were troubled againe with ice, but we made great
shift with it: <i>for we gotte betweene the shoare and it</i>. This day, at twelue of the clocke, we were thwart of the south-east part of Vaigats,
all along which part there was great store of yce, so that we stood in doubt of passage;
<i>yet by much adoe we got betwixt the shoare and it</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1788src" href="#xd33e1788" title="Go to note 41.">41</a>
</p>
<p>They now bore away to the west, passing by the island of Kolguev (Colgoyeue), on the
sands to the south of which both vessels went aground, on August 20th, in latitude
68° 40′ N., according to their calculation. Getting off, they proceeded together on
their return voyage; but, only two days afterwards, Pet’s vessel parted from the William,
and saw her no more.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1794src" href="#xd33e1794" title="Go to note 42.">42</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxxx">[<a href="#pblxxx">lxxx</a>]</span></p>
<p>Arthur Pet, in the George, reached home in safety, arriving at Ratcliff on the 26th
December following; but “the William, with Charles Jackman, arrived at a port in Norway
between Tronden and Rostock in October 1580, and there did winter. And from thence
departed againe in Februarie following, and went in company of a ship of the King
of Denmarke toward Island; and since that time he was never heard of.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1800src" href="#xd33e1800" title="Go to note 43.">43</a>
</p>
<p>This voyage of Pet and Jackman has been noticed more in detail than might otherwise
have been necessary, for the purpose of defending those able seamen from the animadversions
of a recent historian, who says: “From the meagre narrative of this voyage it is sufficiently
evident that Pet and Jackman were but indifferent navigators, and that they never
trusted themselves from the shore and out of shallow water, whenever the ice would
suffer them to approach it; a situation of all others, where they might have made
themselves certain of being hampered with ice.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1807src" href="#xd33e1807" title="Go to note 44.">44</a> It will, however, in the first place, have been seen that their express instructions
were that they should follow the line of the Siberian coast, keeping it always in
sight on their starboard side, which instructions they appear to have obeyed to the
utmost of their ability. And, secondly, it was not so much the fixed ice along the
coast which impeded their progress, as the immense masses of floating ice from the
Polar Basin which had drifted into the Sea of Kara; for, on more than one occasion,
it was precisely by getting into the shallow water, “between the shore and the ice”,
that they were enabled to effect a passage, which in deeper water, where the ice-masses
could float, was denied to them. The fact is that it was from no want of either knowledge
or skill that they were unsuccessful, but from the like unsurmountable natural causes
which, fifteen years later, compelled the Dutch <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxi">[<a href="#pblxxxi">lxxxi</a>]</span>fleet under Cornelius Nai to turn back from somewhere about the same spot;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1812src" href="#xd33e1812" title="Go to note 45.">45</a> and, as Captain Beechey justly observes, “to this day the hardy Russians have not
been able to survey the eastern side of Nova Zembla; and the ships which passed through
the Waigatz Strait have never been able to proceed far, owing to the quantity of ice
driven into the Sea of Kara”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1815src" href="#xd33e1815" title="Go to note 46.">46</a>
</p>
<p>Further, when it is considered who these experienced seamen were, it will at once
be manifest that under no circumstances ought they to be stigmatised as “indifferent
navigators”. Arthur Pet was with Richard Chancellor and Stephen Burrough in the Edward
Bonaventure, on their first voyage to the Bay of St. Nicholas in 1553, his name standing
in the list of “mariners” sixth before that of William Burrough<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1821src" href="#xd33e1821" title="Go to note 47.">47</a> (Stephen’s brother). Seven years afterwards, in 1560, he commanded the Jesus, of
London, in the service of the Russia Company.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1824src" href="#xd33e1824" title="Go to note 48.">48</a> And now, twenty years later, in the year 1580, a convincing proof is afforded of
the estimation in which he was held, by the interest taken in him and his expedition
by several of the most distinguished navigators and cosmographers of his time. For,
in addition to his Commission from his employers, in whose service he had been seven-and-twenty
years,—whether constantly or not is immaterial,—he received “Instructions and Notes”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1828src" href="#xd33e1828" title="Go to note 49.">49</a> from “Master William Burrough”, Comptroller of the Navy, who had been his messmate
seven-and-twenty years before, together with “Certaine briefe aduices giuen by Master
Dee”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1832src" href="#xd33e1832" title="Go to note 50.">50</a> as also “Notes in writing, besides more priuie by mouth, that were giuen by M. Richard
Hakluyt, of Eiton, in the countie of Hereford, esquire”;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1836src" href="#xd33e1836" title="Go to note 51.">51</a> and, further, his voyage <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxii">[<a href="#pblxxxii">lxxxii</a>]</span>was deemed of sufficient importance to form the subject of a letter to Hakluyt himself
from the learned Gerard Mercator.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1849src" href="#xd33e1849" title="Go to note 52.">52</a>
</p>
<p>Of Charles Jackman we do not know so much. Yet he, too, had clearly had experience
in Arctic exploration, having been “the mate” on board the Ayde, one of the vessels
of Frobisher’s second expedition, when he was of sufficient importance to give his
name to “Jackman’s Sound”, on the south side of Frobisher’s Strait.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1854src" href="#xd33e1854" title="Go to note 53.">53</a> And it is not without significance that in all the documents above cited, except
Mercator’s letter to Hakluyt, his name is coupled, without any distinction, with that
of so old and experienced a navigator of the Russian Seas as Arthur Pet.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the failure of Pet and Jackman’s undertaking, the Russia Company appear
to have in no wise relaxed in their endeavours to effect a passage by sea along the
northern coast of the Russian dominions. And that they were, to a considerable extent,
successful in their exertions, is proved by the following two documents, which have
been preserved to us by Purchas.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1861src" href="#xd33e1861" title="Go to note 54.">54</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first hangIndent"><span class="sc">Notes</span> <i>concerning the discouery of the river of Ob, taken out of a Roll written in the Russian
tongue, which was attempted by the meanes of Antonie Marsh, a chiefe Factor for the
Moscouie Company of England, 1584, with other Notes of the North-east</i>.
</p>
<p>First, he wrote a letter from the citie of Mosco, in the year 7092, after the Russe
accompt, which after our accompt was in the yeare 1584, unto foure Russes, that vsed
to trade from Colmogro to Pechora and other parts eastward; whose answer was:
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxiii">[<a href="#pblxxxiii">lxxxiii</a>]</span></p>
<p>By writings receiued from thee, as also by reports, wee vnderstand thou wouldest have
us seeke out the mouth of the riuer Ob; which we are content to doe, and thou must
giue therefore fiftie rubbles: it is requisite to goe to seeke it out with two <i>cochimaes</i> or companies,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1879src" href="#xd33e1879" title="Go to note 55.">55</a> and each <i>cochima</i> must haue ten men; and wee must goe by the riuer Pechora vpwards in the spring, by
the side of the ice, as the ice swimmeth in the riuer, which will aske a fortnights
time; and then we must fall into Ouson riuer, and fall downe with the streame before
we come to Ob, a day and a night in the spring. Then it will hold vs eight dayes to
swimme downe the riuer Ob, before we come to the mouth: therefore send vs a man that
can write; and assure thy selfe the mouth of Ob is deepe. On the Russe side of Ob
soiourne Samoeds, called Vgorskai and Sibierskie Samoeds; and on the other side dwel
another kind of Samoeds, called Monganet or Mongaseisky Samoeds. We must passe by
fiue castles that stand on the riuer of Ob. The name of the first is Tesuoi-gorodok,
which standeth vpon the mouth of the riuer Padou. The second small castle is Nosoro-gorodock,
and it standeth hard vpon the side of Ob. The third is called Necheiour­goskoy. The
fourth is Charedmada. The fift is Nadesneàa, that is to say, the castle of Comfort
or Trust,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1886src" href="#xd33e1886" title="Go to note 56.">56</a> and it standeth vpon the riuer Ob, lowermost of all the former castles toward the
sea.
</p>
<p><i>Heretofore your people haue bin at the said riuer of Obs mouth with a ship, and there
was made shipwracke, and your people were slaine by the Samoeds, which thought that
they came to rob and subdue them.</i> The trees that grow by the riuer are firres, and a kinde of white, soft, and light
firre, which we call <i>yell</i>. The bankes on both sides are very high, and the water not swift, but still and deepe.

Medemske Sauorost to Carareca is sixe dayes sayling. From Carska Bay to the farthest

a day and a nights sayling.

<p><i>He learned another way by Noua Zembla and Matthuschan Yar to Ob more north-eastward.</i> From Caninos to the iland of Colgoieue is a day and a nights sayling. From Colgoieue
to Noua Zembla are two dayes sayling. There is a great <i>osera</i> or lake vpon Noua Zembla, where wonderfull store of geese and swannes doe breede,
and in moulting time cast their feathers, which is about Saint Peters day; and the
Russes of Colmogro repaire thither yearely, and our English men venture thither with
them seuerall shares in money: they bring home great quantitie of doune-feathers,
dried swannes and geese, beares skinnes, and fish, etc. <i>From Naromske reca or riuer to Mattuschan Yar is sixe dayes sayling.</i> From Mattuschan Yar to the Perouologi Teupla, that is to say, to the warme passage

at a low water. The occasion of this highing of <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxv">[<a href="#pblxxxv">lxxxv</a>]</span>the water, is the falling into the sea of the three riuers, and the meeting of the
two seas, to wit, the North Sea and the East Sea, which make both high water and great
sands. And you must beware that you come not with your shippe near vnto the iland

<p>The aforesaid Anthonie Marsh sent one Bodan, his man, a Russe borne, with the aforesaid
foure Russes and a yong youth, a Samoed, which was likewise his seruant, vpon the
discouery of the riuer of Ob by land, through the countrie of the Samoeds, with good
store of commodities to trafficke with the people. And these his seruents made a rich
voyage of it, and had bartered with the people about the riuer of Ob for the valew
of a thousand rubles in sables and other fine furres. But the emperour hauing intelligence
of this discouery, and of the way that Bodan returned home by, by one of his chiefe
officers lay in waite for him, apprehended him, and tooke from him the aforesaid thousand
markes worth of sables and other merchandises and deliuered them into the emperours
treasurie, being sealed vp, and brought the poore fellow Bodan to the citie of Mosco,
where he was committed to prison and whipped, and there detained a long while after,
but in the end released. Moreouer, the emperours officers asked Anthonie Marsh how
he durst presume to deale in any such enterprise. To whom he answered, that, by the
priuileges granted to the English nation, no part of the emperours dominions were
exempted from the English to trade and trafficke in: with which answere they were
not so satisfied, but that they gaue him a great checke, and forfeited all the aforesaid
thousand markes worth of goods, charging him not to proceede any further in that action:
whereby it seemeth they are very iealous that any Christian should grow acquainted
with their neighbours that border to the north-east of their dominions; for that there
is some great secret that way, which they would reserue to themselves onely. Thus
much I vnderstood by Master Christopher Holmes.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>From these documents we gather two very remarkable facts. The first is, that, previously
to the year 1584, an English vessel had crossed the Sea of Kara, and penetrated as
far eastward as the mouth of the river Ob, where it <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxvi">[<a href="#pblxxxvi">lxxxvi</a>]</span>was wrecked and its crew were murdered by the natives. The second is, that, at that
time, the best way from the White Sea and the mouth of the Pechora by sea was deemed
to be “by the isles of Vaygats and Nouva Zembla, <i>and by the Land of Matpheoue, that is, by Matthewes Land</i>”; this being manifestly the same as that which is described as “another way by Noua
Zembla <i>and Mattuschan Yar</i> to Ob, more north-eastward” than that along the Russian coast, by Kanin Nos, the
mouth of the Pechora, and thence through Yugorsky Shar (“Pet’s Strait”) and across
the Gulf of Kara. And there can be no question that we have here a record of the discovery
of the entrance into the Sea of Kara by the strait, at present known by the name of
Matochkin Shar, in which the Russian pilot Rosmuislov passed the winter of 1768–1769,
and through which he penetrated into that sea, though prevented by the ice from proceeding
far from the eastern coast of Novaya Zemlya.<a class="noteRef" id="n.lxxxvi.1src" href="#n.lxxxvi.1" title="Go to note 60.">60</a>
</p>
<p>The singular description thus given by Marsh of this passage through “Mattuschan Yar”,
between Novaya Zemlya and “the Land of Matfeov (Matpheoue)”, does not appear to have
been hitherto noticed by any writer except Dr. Hamel.<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="xd33e1977src" href="#n.lxxxvi.1" title="Go to note 60.">60</a> Unfortunately, that author, through what would seem to be a systematic omission of
all particular reference to his sources of information, has rendered his work of little
value as an authority; inasmuch as, without having the means of appeal to the originals,
it is impossible to discriminate between the facts and opinions gathered by him from
others, and the conclusions, or sometimes mere hypotheses, based by himself on such
information.
</p>
<p>On the present occasion, however, having the original statements of Anthony Marsh
before us, we can have no hesitation in availing ourselves of Dr. Hamel’s comments
on the same, and in agreeing with him<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1982src" href="#xd33e1982" title="Go to note 61.">61</a> that the present name Matochkin Shar appears to be merely a corruption of Matyushin
<span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxvii">[<a href="#pblxxxvii">lxxxvii</a>]</span>Shar; Matyusha itself being the diminutive of the Russian proper-name Matvei, or Matthew,
which name was probably that of the first discoverer of this passage. It would also
seem that the expression “Mattuschan Yar”, made use of by Anthony Marsh, is intended
for this Matyushin Shar, and not, as Dr. Hamel supposes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e1989src" href="#xd33e1989" title="Go to note 62.">62</a> for the coast (<i>yar?</i>) lying opposite to Novaya Zemlya; and that the breadth attributed by Marsh to “Mattuschan
Yar”, of “in some parts forty versts over, and in some parts not past six versts over”,
is meant to apply to the supposed breadth of the passage itself.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>There can, further, be no doubt that Dr. Hamel is right in his conclusion,—indeed,
it is self-evident from Marsh’s statement,—that towards the close of the sixteenth
century, and previously to the time when the Dutch visited those parts, Novaya Zemlya
was looked on as an island extending from Burrough’s Strait (Karskoi Vorota) as far
northwards only as “Mattuschan Yar” (Matyushin Shar): and that the land lying to the
north of this latter passage was not deemed to be a part of Novaya Zemlya, but had
a distinct designation, namely, Matthew’s Land, which in Russian would be Matvyéeva
Zemlya,—an expression which corresponds precisely with Marsh’s “Land of Matfeov (Matpheoue)”.
</p>
<p>How this Matvyéeva Zemlya, together with Matyushin Shar, should have been lost from
our maps, may be easily explained, though not altogether in the way attempted by Dr.
Hamel.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2003src" href="#xd33e2003" title="Go to note 63.">63</a> The accompanying <i>fac-simile</i> of a map drawn by Isaac Massa, and published in 1612 by Hessel Gerard, in a small
volume<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2008src" href="#xd33e2008" title="Go to note 64.">64</a> now very rare, contains (as will be seen) <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxviii">[<a href="#pblxxxviii">lxxxviii</a>]</span>a delineation of Novaya Zemlya, there shown as an island of not large extent, and
the surrounding regions. The strongly marked entire line along the western side of
Novaya Zemlya, is that of the coast as furnished to Massa by his Russian authorities:
the faint dotted line is that of the coast as corrected by himself or Gerard from
Dutch sources of information. The proper names, as written in strong and faint characters
respectively, indicate, in like manner, the several sources from which such names
were derived. In this map a broad channel is laid down between the island of Novaya
Zemlya and a <i lang="la">terra innominata</i> to the north of it, to which channel is given the name of “Matsei of tsar”, which
was evidently intended for “Matſeiof tsar”, which again must be taken to have been
written instead of “Matfeiof tsar”, through a mere clerical error.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2038src" href="#xd33e2038" title="Go to note 65.">65</a> The faint dotted line along the west coast of Novaya Zemlya shows that it had been
carefully and (considering the time when it was drawn) very accurately corrected;
for we there see plainly laid down the Mezhdusharsky Ostrov and the two inlets—Kostin
Shar and Podryesov Shar—between which <span class="pageNum" id="pblxxxix">[<a href="#pblxxxix">lxxxix</a>]</span>that island lies, and from which it derives its appellation.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2068src" href="#xd33e2068" title="Go to note 66.">66</a>
</p>
<p>Had the name Kostin Shar, in any of its chameleon forms,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2073src" href="#xd33e2073" title="Go to note 67.">67</a> been retained in its proper place, at the same time that the new name Matfeiof tsar
was introduced to designate the more northerly channel,—and the map constructed by
Gerrit de Veer from William Barents’s observations, does not warrant the former’s
being carried much higher up than the 71st parallel,—there would most probably have
been no occasion to notice this grave error. But the passage between Novaya Zemlya
(Proper) and Matvyéeva Zemlya not having been observed by Barents and his companions,
and De Veer having in his journal expressed the opinion that “Constinsarck” goes “through
to the Tartarian Sea”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2078src" href="#xd33e2078" title="Go to note 68.">68</a> the corrector of Massa’s map was led to suppose that this passage must be the same
as the “Matfeiof tsar” of the Russians, and he accordingly placed over the latter
the name “Costint sarch” in faint letters. That in subsequent maps the former name
should have been omitted, and the latter alone retained, is only natural: it is the
usual progress of error. Accordingly, in Gerard’s map of Russia, dedicated to the
emperor Michael Fedorowich in 1614,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2081src" href="#xd33e2081" title="Go to note 69.">69</a> we find “Costint sarch” made to extend right across and through the land from west
to east, its latitude being, however, brought down to nearly the same as in Gerrit
de Veer’s map, from which the western coast-line of Novaya Zemlya is, in <span class="pageNum" id="pbxc">[<a href="#pbxc">xc</a>]</span>general, taken, while the more northerly passage is altogether lost sight of.
</p>
<p>Still, the existence of this latter passage continued to be known more than a century
later. For, in the year 1705, Witsen published in the second volume of his <i>Noord en Oost Tartarye</i>, a rough and, for the most part, very incorrect map of the Samoede country, obtained
by him from Theunis (Antonis) Ys, the master of a trading vessel, who had visited
Novaya Zemlya; in which map the southern portion of that country is represented as
an island, cut off from the northern and far larger portion by a broad channel, running
from north-west to south-east, and bearing the name of “Matiskin jar, of Mathys-stroom”;
with respect to which channel Witsen remarks,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2100src" href="#xd33e2100" title="Go to note 70.">70</a> that “it is a passage and thoroughfare, and not an inlet or river”.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the length of time during which the name has been lost, there does
not appear to be any good reason why the original and correct designation of Matthew’s
Strait, Matvyéeva Shar (“Matfeiof tsar”), or Matyushin Shar, should not be restored
to the channel between the two islands, instead of its continuing to bear the modern
corrupted form of the latter name, Matochkin Shar.
</p>
<p>It likewise seems only right that the name Matthew’s Land (the “Land of Matpheoue”)
or Matvyéeva Zemlya, should not be lost from our maps; and it is therefore proposed
to appropriate that designation to the small island extending from Matyushin Shar
(“Matochkin Shar”) northwards as far as the channel, in about 74° N. lat., running
across the land from Cross Bay to Rosmuislov’s “Unknown Bay”.
</p>
<p>As to the name Novaya Zemlya, there can be no doubt that it ought still to continue
the generic appellation of the entire series of islands, of which the country usually
known by that name is now found to consist. But, at the same <span class="pageNum" id="pbxci">[<a href="#pbxci">xci</a>]</span>time, as it is highly expedient that each of those islands should possess some distinctive
specific designation, there is a propriety in restricting the title of Novaya Zemlya
(Proper), as it appears in the map of Isaac Massa and Theunis Ys, to the southernmost
island of the series, lying between the Kara Gate or Burroughs Strait to the south
and Matyushin Shar or Matthew’s Strait to the north.
</p>
<p>The establishment of the English in the White Sea, and their explorations to the eastwards,
soon induced others to become their competitors; and of these it is not unnatural
that the Russians themselves should have been among the first. Accordingly, we find
that a short time previously to the year 1581, “two famous men”, named Yacovius and
Unekius—which, as Lütke observes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2111src" href="#xd33e2111" title="Go to note 71.">71</a> are manifestly the Latinised forms of the Russian names Yakov and Anikyi—employed
a Swedish shipwright to build for them two ships in the river Dwina, and then sent
one Alferius, by birth a Netherlander (“natione Belga”), to Antwerp to engage pilots
and mariners, with a view to their employment on board those ships in discoveries
towards the north-east. This Alferius—or Oliver, as Hakluyt translates the name—was
the bearer of a letter from John Balak to Gerard Mercator, which letter, written in
Latin, was published by Hakluyt in his <i>Principal Navigations</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2116src" href="#xd33e2116" title="Go to note 72.">72</a> together with an English translation.
</p>
<p>On account of the very curious matter bearing on our subject which this letter contains,
it is thought advisable to reprint it here in its English form, and also to give the
original Latin in the Appendix,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2121src" href="#xd33e2121" title="Go to note 73.">73</a> for the convenience of reference.

<p class="first hangIndent"><span class="sc">To</span> <i>the famous and renowned Gerardus Mercator, his reuerend and singular friend, at Duisburg
in Cliueland, these be deliuered</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Calling</span> to remembrance (most deare friend) what exceeding delight you tooke, at our being
together, in reading the geographicall writings of Homer, Strabo, Aristotle, Plinie,
Dion, and the rest, I reioyced not a little that I happened vpon such a messenger
as the bearer of these presents (whom I do especially recommend vnto you), who arriued
lately here at Arusburg, upon the riuer of Osella. This mans experience (as I am of
opinion) will greatly auaile you to the knowledge of a certaine matter, which hath
bene by you so vehemently desired and so curiously laboured for, and concerning the
which the late cosmographers do hold such varietie of opinions: namely, of the discouerie
of the huge promontorie of Tabin, and of the famous and rich countreys subiect unto
the emperor of Cathay, and that by the northeast Ocean Sea. The man is called Alferius,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2136src" href="#xd33e2136" title="Go to note 74.">74</a> being by birth a Netherlander, who, for certaine yeeres, liued captiue in the dominions
of Russia, vnder two famous men, Yacouius and Vnekius, by whom he was sent to Antwerp,
to procure skilfull pilots and mariners (by propounding liberall rewards), to go vnto
the two famous personages aforesayd, which two had set a Sweden shipwright on worke
to build two ships for the same discouerie, vpon the riuer of Dwina. The passage vnto
Cathay by the northeast (as he declareth the matter, albeit without arte, yet very
aptly, as you may well perceiue, which I request you diligently to consider), is,
without doubt, very short and easie. This very man himselfe hath trauelled to the
riuer of Ob, both by land, through the countreys of the Samoeds and of Sibier, and
also by sea, along the coast of the riuer Pechora, eastward. Being encouraged by this
his experience, he is fully resolued with himselfe to conduct a barke laden with merchandize
(the keele whereof hee will not haue to drawe ouer much water) to the Baie of Saint
Nicholas, in Russia, being furnished with all things expedient for such a discouerie,
and with a new supply of victuals at his arrivall there; and also to hire into his
companie certaine Russes best knowen vnto himselfe, who can perfectly speake the Samoeds
language, and are acquainted with the riuer of Ob, as hauing frequented those places
yeere by yeere.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbxciii">[<a href="#pbxciii">xciii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whereupon, about the ende of May, hee is determined to saile from the Baie of S. Nicholas
eastward, by the maine of Ioughoria, and so to the easterly parts of Pechora, to the
island which is called Dolgoia. And here also hee is purposed to obserue the latitudes,
to suruey and describe the countrey, to sound the depth of the sea, and to note the
distances of places, where and so oft as occasion shall be offered. And forasmuch
as the Baie of Pechora is a most conuenient place both for harbour and victuall, as
well in their going foorth as in their returne home, in regard of ice and tempest,
he is determined to bestow a day in sounding the flats, and in searching out the best
enterance for ships: in which place, heretofore, he found the water to be but fiue
foote deepe, howbeit he doubteth not but that there are deeper chanels: and then he
intendeth to proceed on along those coasts for the space of three or foure leagues,
leauing the island called Vaigats almost in the middle way betweene Vgoria and Noua
Zembla: then also to passe by a certaine baie betweene Vaigats and Ob, trending southerly
into the land of Vgoria, whereinto fall two small riuers, called Marmesia and Carah,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2144src" href="#xd33e2144" title="Go to note 75.">75</a> vpon the which riuers doe inhabite an other barbarous and sauage nation of the Samoeds.
He found many flats in that tract of land, and many cataracts or ouerfals of water,
yet such as hee was able to saile by. When hee shall come to the riuer of Ob, which
riuer (as the Samoeds report) hath seuentie mouthes, which, by reason of the huge
breadth thereof, containing many and great islands, which are inhabited with sundry
sortes of people, no man scarcely can well discouer; because he will not spend too
much time, he purposeth to search three or foure, at the most, of the mouthes thereof,
those chiefly which shall be thought most commodious by the aduise of the inhabitants,
of whom hee meaneth to haue certaine with him in his voyage, and meaneth to employ
three or foure boates of that countrey in search of these mouthes, as neere as possibly
he can to the shore, which, within three dayes iourney of the sea, is inhabited, that
he may learne where the riuer is best nauigable. If it so fall out that he may sayle
vp the riuer Ob against the streame, and mount up to that place which heretofore,
accompanied with certaine of his friends, he passed vnto by land through the countrey
of Siberia, which is about twelue dayes iourney from the sea, where the riuer Ob falleth
into the sea, which place is in the <span class="pageNum" id="pbxciv">[<a href="#pbxciv">xciv</a>]</span>continent neere the riuer Ob, and is called Yaks Olgush, borowing his name from that
mightie riuer which falleth into the riuer Ob; then, doubtlesse, hee would conceive
full hope that hee had passed the greatest difficulties: for the people dwelling there
about report, which were three dayes sayling onely from that place beyond the riuer
Ob, whereby the bredth thereof may be gathered (which is a rare matter there, because
that many rowing with their boates of leather one dayes iourney onely from the shore,
haue bene cast away in tempest, hauing no skill to guide themselves neither by sunne
nor starre), that they haue seene great vessels, laden with rich and precious merchandize,
brought downe that great riuer by black or swart people. They call that riuer Ardoh,
which falleth into the lake of Kittay, which they call Paraha,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2153src" href="#xd33e2153" title="Go to note 76.">76</a> whereupon bordereth that mightie and large nation which they call Carrah Colmak,
which is none other than the nation of Cathay.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2156src" href="#xd33e2156" title="Go to note 77.">77</a> There, if neede require, he may fitly winter and refresh himselfe and his, and seeke
all things which he shall stand in need of; which, if it so fall out, he doubteth
not but in the meane while he shall be much furthered in searching and learning out
many things in that place. Howbeit, he hopeth that hee shall reach to Cathaya that
very sommer, unlesse he be hindered by great abundance of ice at the mouth of the
riuer of Ob, which is sometimes more, and sometimes lesse. If it so fall out, hee
then purposeth to returne to Pechora, and there to winter; or if he cannot doe so
neither, then hee meaneth to returne to the riuer of Dwina, whither he will reach
in good time enough, and so the next spring following to proceed on his voyage. One
thing in due place I forgate before.
</p>
<p>The people which dwell at that place called Yaks Olgush, affirme that they haue heard
their forefathers say that they have heard most sweete harmonie of bels<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2165src" href="#xd33e2165" title="Go to note 78.">78</a> in the lake of Kitthay, and that they haue seene therein stately and large buildings:
and when they make mention of the people named Carrah Colmak (this countrey is Cathay),
they fetch deepe sighes, and holding vp their hands, they looke vp to heaven, signifying,
as it were, and declaring the notable glory and <span class="pageNum" id="pbxcv">[<a href="#pbxcv">xcv</a>]</span>magnificence of that nation. I would this Oliuer were better seene in cosmographie;
it would greatly further his experience, which doubtlesse is very great. Most deare
friend, I omit many things, and I wish you should heare the man himselfe, which promised
me faithfully that he would visite you in his way at Duisburg; for he desireth to
conferre with you, and doubtlesse you shall very much further the man. He seemeth
sufficiently furnished with money and friends, wherein, and in other offices of curtesie,
I offered him my furtherance, if it had pleased him to haue vsed me. The Lord prosper
the mans desires and forwardnesse, blesse his good beginnings, further his proceedings,
and grant vnto him most happy issue. Fare you well, good sir and my singular friend.

<p>It is not known what success attended this Alferius or Oliver in his scheme, or what
subsequently became of him; unless, indeed, it be assumed that he is the Oliver Brunel
(or Bunel), concerning whom several unconnected notices are met with, and with respect
to whom various conflicting opinions have been entertained. The early history of the
discovery of Novaya Zemlya would hardly be complete were these notices and opinions
passed over in silence.
</p>
<p>The first mention made of this individual is by Gerrit de Veer, when speaking, in
page 30 of the present work, of “a great creeke, which William Barents iudged to be
the place where Oliuer Brunel had been before, called Costincsarch”.
</p>
<p>The next is Henry Hudson, who, on his second voyage to discover a passage to the East
Indies by the north-east, in 1608, having entered into this same creek, in the hope
of its affording him a way through into the Sea of Kara, expresses himself as follows:—“This
place vpon Noua Zembla is another then that which the Hollanders call Costing Sarch,
discouered by Oliuer Brownell: and William Barentsons obseruation doth witnesse the
same. It is layd in plot by the Hollanders out of his true place too farre north;
to <span class="pageNum" id="pbxcvi">[<a href="#pbxcvi">xcvi</a>]</span>what end I know not, unlesse to make it hold course with the compasse, not respecting
the variation.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2184src" href="#xd33e2184" title="Go to note 79.">79</a>
</p>
<p>In this, however, Hudson was mistaken. The creek into which he entered was really
Kostin Shar; and his error in supposing it to be another “than that which the Hollanders
call Costing Sarch”, arose from the circumstance that in the Dutch maps that name
had been removed northwards to Matfeiov-tsar (Matvyéeva Shar) or Matyushin Shar, and
made to supersede the original name. The whole of Hudson’s account of his visit to
Novaya Zemlya is of so interesting a character, that it is deemed deserving of a place
in the Appendix to the present work,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2190src" href="#xd33e2190" title="Go to note 80.">80</a> especially as it has hitherto been either overlooked or else made use of to very
little good purpose.
</p>
<p>In 1611, three years after Hudson’s visit to Novaya Zemlya, Josiah Logan went on a
voyage to the Pechora, and on the 27th of August of that year we find the following
entry in his journal, which, like that of Hudson, is published by Purchas:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2195src" href="#xd33e2195" title="Go to note 81.">81</a>—“We came to an iland called Mezyou Sharry, being sixtie versts to the eastwards of
Suatinose, and it is about ten versts in length and two versts broad. At the east
end thereof Oliver Brunell was carried into harbour by a Russe, where he was land-locked,
hauing the iland on the one side and the mayne on the other.” It is here manifest
that Logan’s “Mezyou Sharry” Island is the Mezhdusharsky Ostrov, or “the island between
the two straits”, of the Russians.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2198src" href="#xd33e2198" title="Go to note 82.">82</a>
</p>
<p>From these several statements of three seamen, who visited Kostin Shar at different
periods between the years 1594 and 1611, the only facts to be elicited are, that,
at some time previous to the former date, this strait was first discovered by some
well-known individual, named Oliver Brunel, who was there exposed to some danger or
difficulty, <span class="pageNum" id="pbxcvii">[<a href="#pbxcvii">xcvii</a>]</span>from which he was rescued by the crew of a Russian vessel. That he was, however, subsequently
lost at the mouth of the river Pechora is made known to us in the work of Hessel Gerard
already referred to.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2207src" href="#xd33e2207" title="Go to note 83.">83</a>
</p>
<p>As this work of Gerard is but little known, the commencement of the author’s Preface
(<i>Prolegomena</i>) shall be reprinted here, both on account of its clearing up the history of Oliver
Brunel, and also because it shows the important bearing which his adventure had on
the subsequent voyages of the Dutch, which form the subject of the following pages.

</p>
<p>Oliver Brunel, or “Bunel”, was therefore no Englishman, but a native of Brussels;
and if the particulars thus recorded of him and of the motives of his enterprise be
correctly stated, he would scarcely seem to be the Alferius of Balak’s letter to Mercator.
Still, the point cannot be looked on as absolutely decided. One further remark is
necessary with respect to the spelling of his name. On the one hand, it will be seen
that, according to De Veer and Logan, it is “Brunel” or “Brunell”, while Hudson makes
it to be “Brownell”, which latter may, however, be regarded as merely a <i>broad</i> pronunciation of the word, or perhaps an attempt to give it a vernacular and significant
form;—a process with respect to proper names not unusual among seamen of all nations.
On the other hand, Gerard writes <span class="pageNum" id="pbxcix">[<a href="#pbxcix">xcix</a>]</span>“Bunel”. But this form cannot be allowed to stand in opposition to the conjoint authority
of the three seamen, all writing separately and without concert; and we may quite
reasonably conjecture the <i>r</i> to have been left out by Gerard, through some clerical or typographical error.
</p>
<p>Gerard’s work must have come to the knowledge of Purchas soon after its publication;
for, in the year 1625, it is referred to <span class="corr" id="xd33e2253" title="Source: be">by</span> the latter<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2256src" href="#xd33e2256" title="Go to note 86.">86</a> as his authority for the following statement:—“The Dutch themselues<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2260src" href="#xd33e2260" title="Go to note 87.">87</a> write that after the English Russian trade, one Oliuer Bunell, moued with hope of
gaine, went from Enckhuysen to Pechora, where he lost all by shipwracke, hauing discouered
Costinsarca in Noua Zemla. These nauigations of the English, and that of Bunell, and
the hopes of China and Cathay, caused the States Generall to send forth two shippes,
vnder the command of Hugo Linschoten, to the Streights of Wey-gates, and two others,
vnder William Bernards, by the perswasion of P. Plancius, to goe right northwards
from Noua Zemla.”
</p>
<p>Nearly a century later, Witsen, in his oft-cited work,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2279src" href="#xd33e2279" title="Go to note 88.">88</a> writes as follows:—“<span lang="nl">Het zijn veele jaren geleden, en lange voor Willem Barents-zoons reis, dat eenen Olivier
Bunel, met een scheepje van Enkhuizen uitgevaren, deze rivier [Petsora] heeft bezocht,
daer hy veel pelterye, Rusch glas, en bergkristal vergaderd hadde; doch is aldaer
komen te blyven.</span>” Witsen does not cite any authority for this statement; <span class="pageNum" id="pbc">[<a href="#pbc">c</a>]</span>but it bears internal evidence of having been taken from Gerard, whose work we know
he had before him. That both he and Purchas should have written the name “Bunel”,
and not “Brunel”, is perfectly natural, and adds nothing to the weight of evidence
in favour of the former spelling.
</p>
<p>The next writer to be mentioned is Johann Reinhold Forster, who, in his <i>Voyages and Discoveries in the North</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2291src" href="#xd33e2291" title="Go to note 89.">89</a> after referring to De Veer’s statement respecting Oliver Brunel,—whom, however, he
styles “Bennel”, on what authority it is impossible to say—adds in a note:—“It is
manifest that the navigators mentioned here, who had been in Nova Zembla previous
to Barentz’s arrival there, were Englishmen; for the name Oliver Bennel is entirely
English, and the name of the inlet, which Barentz calls <i>Constint Sarch</i>, can hardly have been any other than <i>Constant Search</i>; but in which of the known voyages of the English into these parts this place was
thus named, or whether Oliver Bennel made a voyage for the sole purpose of making
discoveries, or was cast away here in his way to other regions, cannot easily be determined,
for want of proper information on the subject.”
</p>
<p>The absurdity of Forster’s derivation of the name <i>Kostin Shar</i> is manifest from the explanation of it given in page 30 (note 4) of the present work.
And as to the allegation that <span class="corr" id="xd33e2302" title="Not in source">“</span>the name Oliver <i>Bennel</i> is entirely English”, it could only have been made by a foreigner. On the contrary,
it may be asserted that such a name as “Bennel” is altogether un-English; and were
it not for the cosmopolitan character of our English surnames, it might—had it really
been that of the individual in question—in itself be fairly taken as evidence that
he was <i>not</i> an Englishman. With much more reason might we, at the present day, claim “Brunel”
as an English name. Probably Forster had in <span class="pageNum" id="pbci">[<a href="#pbci">ci</a>]</span>his mind the “entirely English” name of Stephen Bennet, the well-known walrus-hunter
on Bear (Cherie) Island.
</p>
<p>But the confusion as to Oliver Brunel does not rest here. Sir John Barrow, in his
work already cited,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2312src" href="#xd33e2312" title="Go to note 90.">90</a> says:—“The Dutch themselves admit, that an <i>Englishman</i> of the name of Brunell or Brownell, ‘moved with the hope of gain, went from Enkhuysen
to Pechora’, where he lost all by shipwreck, after he had been on the coast of Nova
Zembla, and given the name of Costin-sarca (qu. <i>Coasting-search</i> ?) to a bay situated in about 71½°.” And in another place,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2320src" href="#xd33e2320" title="Go to note 91.">91</a> the same writer speaks of Oliver Brunel as “an Englishman, of whom a vague mention
only is made by the Dutch.”
</p>
<p>With the statements of the various writers who preceded Barrow before us, we can see
at a glance, though no authorities are cited by him, that he took that of Purchas
as his basis, modifying it by means of those of Hudson, Logan, and Forster. It is
to be regretted that he did not refer to the original Dutch authority cited by Purchas.
</p>
<p>The last modern writer who treats of Oliver Brunel is Dr. Hamel, who, assuming him
to be the Alferius of Balak, makes him, in his work already cited,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2330src" href="#xd33e2330" title="Go to note 92.">92</a> the subject of an hypothetical biographical memoir, beginning with the words, “<span lang="de">Ich finde es wahrscheinlich</span>”, but without seeming to be aware of what Gerard says respecting his hero, except
so far only as it is repeated by Witsen. By this writer, therefore, no additional
light is thrown on the subject now under consideration; and, in fact, it is to the
original authority, after all, that we must revert for the only information that is
really available and useful.
</p>
<p>From this authority, then, we learn that Oliver Brunel, a native of Brussels, went
in a vessel belonging to the town <span class="pageNum" id="pbcii">[<a href="#pbcii">cii</a>]</span>of Enkhuysen on a trading voyage into the Russian seas, where, after collecting a
valuable cargo, he was lost; and that his enterprise (though unsuccessful), together
with those of the English in the same quarter, induced the Dutch to set on foot the
memorable expeditions which form the subject of the following pages. If this person
was really the Alferius who was recommended by Balak to Mercator in the year 1581,
he must subsequently have been engaged in the Russian trade for several years before
his unlucky end; or else Gerard, writing in 1612, would surely not have named him
as an immediate cause of an undertaking which was not projected till 1593.
</p>
<p>It is not, however, to be imagined that the Netherlanders—we can scarcely speak of
the “Dutch” at the earliest period to which we are now adverting—had no previous connexion
with the northern coasts of Russia, though it is true that that connexion was then
but of recent date. For, as is stated by Edge, the English Russia Company having “made
their first discoverie in the yeere 1553, there was neuer heard of any Netherlander
that frequented those seas vntil the yeere 1578. At which time they first began to
come to Cola, and within a yeere or two after, one Iohn de Whale [de Walle], a Netherlander,
came to the Bay of Saint Nicholas, being drawne thither by the perswasion of some
English, for their better meane of interloping; which was the first man of that nation
that euer was seene there.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2343src" href="#xd33e2343" title="Go to note 93.">93</a> It was this same John de Walle, who was afterwards present at the coronation of the
Emperor Fedor Ivanovich, at Moscow, on the 10th of June, 1584, when he had a dispute
with Jerome Horsey, the English ambassador, as to precedency, which was decided by
the emperor in favour of the latter. He is described by Horsey as “a famous merchant
of Netherland, being newly come to <span class="pageNum" id="pbciii">[<a href="#pbciii">ciii</a>]</span>Mosco, who gaue himselfe out to be the king of Spaines subiect.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2351src" href="#xd33e2351" title="Go to note 94.">94</a>
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary, for the consideration of the subject before us, to enter into any
details respecting the commercial and political relations with Russia of the Netherlanders
generally, in the first instance, and eventually of the natives of the United Provinces—commonly,
though not very correctly, called <i>the Dutch</i>—in particular. It is sufficient to remark, that after their first entrance into the
White Sea, they soon became powerful rivals of the English in the trade with Russia,
and that it was also not long before their attention was directed to the extension
of their commerce to the eastward of that country, and to the endeavour to reach China
and the Indian Seas by a passage to the north-east.
</p>
<p>Among the earliest and most eminent Dutch merchants trading to the White Sea, was
Balthazar Moucheron, of the town of Middelburg, in Zeelandt. He it was, who, in the
year 1593, in conjunction with Jacob Valck, treasurer of the same town, and Dr. Francis
Maelson, of Enkhuysen, syndic of West Friesland, conceived the project of fitting
out two fly-boats (<i>vlyboots</i>), each of between fifty and sixty lasts, or about one hundred tons, burthen, armed
and provisioned for eight months, being one from each of those towns, to attempt a
voyage to China and India by the way of the Northern Ocean. In this enterprise they
were assisted by the courts of admiralty of those two provinces, having first obtained
the necessary permission from the higher authorities.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2362src" href="#xd33e2362" title="Go to note 95.">95</a>
</p>
<p>The two vessels thus fitted up were the Swan (<i>Swane</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2372src" href="#xd33e2372" title="Go to note 96.">96</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pbciv">[<a href="#pbciv">civ</a>]</span>of Ter Veere, in Zeelandt, under the command of Cornelis Corneliszoon Nai (or Nay),
a burgher of Enkhuysen, who had for some years been a pilot or master of a merchantman
in the Russian trade, in Moucheron’s service, and was well acquainted with the northern
coasts of Europe; having with him, as under-pilot or mate, Pieter Dirckszoon Strickbolle,
also of Enkhuysen, and, like Nai, in the service of Moucheron. The other vessel was
the Mercury (<i>Mercurius</i>), of Enkhuysen, under the command of Brant Ysbrantszoon, otherwise Brant Tetgales,
a skilful and experienced seaman, with Claes Corneliszoon as his mate or under-pilot;
both being likewise natives of Enkhuysen. As supercargo and interpreter on board the
Swan went François de la Dale, a relative of Moucheron, who had resided several years
in Russia, and as additional interpreter, “Meester” Christoffel Splindler, a Slavonian
by birth, who had studied in the university of Leyden; while on board the Mercury
the supercargo was John Hugh van Linschoten,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2384src" href="#xd33e2384" title="Go to note 97.">97</a> who was likewise engaged to keep a journal of their proceedings.
</p>
<p>This movement on the part of the merchants of Middelburg and Enkhuysen had the effect
of inducing those of Amsterdam to desire to participate in the enterprise, or, it
should rather be said, to undertake one on their own account, having the same general
object in view, but adopting a somewhat different mode of carrying it out. Instead
of attempting a way to China by passing between Novaya Zemlya and the Russian continent,
the Amsterdammers, at the instance of the celebrated cosmographer and astronomer,
Peter Plancius, decided on sending their vessel round to the north of Novaya Zemlya,
as offering a far easier and preferable route. This difference of opinion between
the promoters of the two parts of the first expedition must be borne in mind, as explaining
several circumstances which, <span class="pageNum" id="pbcv">[<a href="#pbcv">cv</a>]</span>in the course of our subsequent narrative, will have to be adverted to. A third vessel
was accordingly fitted out by the merchants of Amsterdam, aided by the court of admiralty
there. It was of the same size and character as the other two, and like Tetgales’s
vessel was named the Mercury (<i>Mercurius</i>);<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2393src" href="#xd33e2393" title="Go to note 98.">98</a> its command being entrusted to William Barents,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2405src" href="#xd33e2405" title="Go to note 99.">99</a> who took with him also a fishing-boat belonging to Ter Schelling.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2408src" href="#xd33e2408" title="Go to note 100.">100</a>
</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, a few words must be said respecting the individual whose
name has become inseparably associated with the three memorable expeditions, of which
the first is now under consideration.
</p>
<p>Willem Barentszoon—that is to say, William, the son of Barent or Bernard—was a native
of Ter Schelling, an island belonging to the province of Friesland, and lying to the
north-east of Vlieland or ’tVlie. He was also a burgher of Amsterdam. Of his family
and early life no particulars have been handed down to us. But that he was not of
any considerable family is manifest from his having, like most of his countrymen in
the lower, or even the middle ranks of life, no other surname than the patronymic,
Barents-zoon. He possessed, however, a good, if not a learned education, as is proved
by the translation made by him from the High Dutch into his native tongue of the “Treatise
of Iver Boty, a Gronlander,” which together with a note written by him on the tides
in the Sea of Kara, was found by Purchas <span class="pageNum" id="pbcvi">[<a href="#pbcvi">cvi</a>]</span>“amongst Master Hakluyt’s paper,” and preserved by him, and which, following that
laborious collector’s example, we have “thought good to adde hither for Barents or
Barentsons sake.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2416src" href="#xd33e2416" title="Go to note 101.">101</a> He appears also to have written the narrative of the first voyage, which was published
by Gerrit de Veer, and of which a translation is given in the present volume. Nothing
to that effect is stated by De Veer; but as the latter did not go on that voyage,
he must necessarily have obtained the particulars of it from some one who did, and
from Linschoten’s statement<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2419src" href="#xd33e2419" title="Go to note 102.">102</a> it may be inferred that this was Barents himself.
</p>
<p>But whatever may have been Barents’s general education, it is unquestionable that
he was a man of considerable capacity and talent, and that as a seaman he was possessed
of far more than ordinary acquirements. By Linschoten he is described as having great
knowledge of the science of navigation, and as being a practical seaman of much experience
and ability; his astronomical observations have stood the severest tests of modern
science; while his feats of seamanship will bear comparison with those of the ablest
and most daring of our modern navigators. Of his great determination, perseverance,
and indomitable courage, some remarkable instances will be adduced; and that his personal
character, and general conduct, were such as to secure to him the respect, confidence,
and attachment of those who sailed with him, is clearly manifest from various expressions
in Gerrit de Veer’s simple narrative, and from its tone throughout.
</p>
<p>The name of this able navigator has been written in various ways. The Dutch usually
have Barentsz., which has been adopted in the notes on Phillip’s text in the <span class="pageNum" id="pbcvii">[<a href="#pbcvii">cvii</a>]</span>present volume, it being the usual native contraction of the full name, Barentszoon.
In the Amsterdam Latin and French versions of De Veer’s work, the name is translated
“<span lang="la">filius Bernardi</span>,” and “<span lang="fr">fils de Bernard</span>”. Purchas and other early English writers, have Barents or Barentson, and sometimes
even Bernardson. The first of these forms—namely, <i>Barents</i>—is most conformable to the genius of our language (in which we have Williams and
Williamson, Richards and Richardson, etc.), at the same time that it accords with
that of the Dutch, in which language this form of name is not uncommon. Barentz and
Barentzen, as it has not unfrequently been written, are incorrect.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of June, 1594, the little fleet lying off Huysdunen, by the Texel, the
commander of the Swan, Cornelis Nai, was named admiral or commodore, and an agreement
made<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2441src" href="#xd33e2441" title="Go to note 103.">103</a> that they should keep company as far as Kildin, on the coast of Lapland. On the following
morning, being Sunday, the admiral set sail, commanding the others to follow; but
as the Amsterdammers said they were not quite ready, they remained behind, though,
as appears from their journal,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2446src" href="#xd33e2446" title="Go to note 104.">104</a> they too sailed in the course of the same day. On the 21st, the Mercury of Enkhuysen
arrived at Kildin, on the 22nd, the Swan, and on the 23rd, <span class="corr" id="xd33e2449" title="Source: Barent’s">Barents’</span> two vessels. On the 29th of the same month Barents left Kildin on his separate voyage
to Novaya Zemlya, arranging with the others that, in case they should not meet beyond
that country, but should have to return, they would wait for one another at Kildin
till the end of September. On the 2nd of July the ships of Nai and Tetgales took their
departure for Vaigats.
</p>
<p>For want of taking a comprehensive view of this, and the subsequent voyages in which
Barents was engaged, most writers on the subject have fallen into considerable <span class="pageNum" id="pbcviii">[<a href="#pbcviii">cviii</a>]</span>error. By some the two expeditions of Nai and Barents have been treated as totally
distinct; while by others Barents has been regarded as the chief commander of the
whole. Thus, Blaeu, in the first part of his <i lang="fr">Grand Atlas</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2459src" href="#xd33e2459" title="Go to note 105.">105</a> published at Amsterdam in 1667, speaks of this expedition in the following terms:—“<span lang="fr">Dans cette grande entreprise, la ville d’Amsterdam, aujourd’huy la plus puissante
des sept Provinces unies, se porta des premières, et fournit deux vaisseaux, qui furent
accompagnez d’un troisiesme de Zelande et d’un quatrième d’Enchuse, <i>tous quatre excellemment equippez, et qui eurent pour principal gouverneur et pilote
tres-expert Guillaume fils de Bernard</i>.</span>” It would be a mere loss of time to refer to what other writers have said on the
subject.
</p>
<p>The voyage of William Barents in the Mercury of Amsterdam, forms the subject of the
“First Part” of the present volume. Without entering here into any needless repetition
of the particulars of this voyage, it shall be merely remarked that on the 4th of
July, Barents first came in sight of Novaya Zemlya in 73° 25′ N. lat., near a low
projecting point, called by him Langenes, whence he proceeded northwards along the
coast, till, on the 10th of the same month, he passed Cape Nassau.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2469src" href="#xd33e2469" title="Go to note 106.">106</a> Thus far he had met with no obstacle to his progress. But during the night of the
13th he fell in with immense quantities of ice, and here his difficulties began. After
vainly endeavouring to make his way through the ice, he, on the 19th of the month,
found himself again close to the land about Cape Nassau.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2472src" href="#xd33e2472" title="Go to note 107.">107</a> Nothing daunted, he once more struggled forwards, and at length, on the last day
of July, reached the Islands of Orange. Here, “after he had taken all that paine,
and finding that he could hardly get through to accomplish and ende his intended voyage,
his men also beginning to bee weary and would saile no further, they all <span class="pageNum" id="pbcix">[<a href="#pbcix">cix</a>]</span>together agreed to returne back againe.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2478src" href="#xd33e2478" title="Go to note 108.">108</a> On the following day, therefore, they commenced their homeward voyage, and on the
3rd of August they reached Cape Nassau.
</p>
<p>From a perusal of the mere dry details of their various courses in this part of their
voyage, which are nearly all that is recorded in their journal, no idea could be formed
of the difficulties they had to contend with, or the amount of labour actually performed.
It is only when their track is laid down on the map,—as it has been, most carefully
and with all possible accuracy, by Mr. Augustus <span class="corr" id="xd33e2483" title="Source: Peterman">Petermann</span>,—that their enormous exertions become apparent. The result is really astonishing.
Their voyage from Cape Nassau to the Orange islands and back occupied them from the
10th of July till the 3rd of August, being twenty-five days. During this period, Barents
put his ship about eighty-one times, and sailed 1,546 geographical miles, according
to the distances noted in the journal; to which, however, must be added the courses
sailed along the coast, and also those which in some instances have been omitted to
be specified, so that it may be reasonably assumed that the entire distance gone over
was not much (if anything) short of 1,700 miles. This is equal to the distance from
the Thames to the northern extremity of Spitzbergen, or from Cape Nassau to Cape Yakan,
not far from Bering’s Strait. And all this was performed in a vessel of one hundred
tons’ burthen, accompanied by a fishing smack!
</p>
<p>One remarkable fact must not be omitted to be mentioned. On laying down Barents’s
track from the bearings and distances given in his journal, from the 10th to the 19th
of July, being the interval between his passing Cape Nassau, and being driven back
again to that point,—during which period he tacked about in numerous directions, and
sailed more than six hundred miles,—Mr. Petermann found it to agree so accurately,
that its termination <span class="pageNum" id="pbcx">[<a href="#pbcx">cx</a>]</span>fell precisely upon Cape Nassau, without any difference whatever. This extreme precision
can hardly be regarded as anything but a singular coincidence. Nevertheless, when
viewed in connexion with Barents’s other tracks, and with his observations generally,
as tested by the recent explorations of Lütke and other modern navigators, it must
still remain a striking proof of the wonderful ability and accuracy of that extraordinary
man.
</p>
<p>After passing Cape Nassau, Barents continued his course southwards without any remarkable
incident, till on the 15th of August he reached the islands of “Matfloe and Dolgoy,”—Matvyeéa
Ostrov and Dolgoi Ostrov of the Russians, meaning Matthew’s Island and Long Island,—where
he fell in with Nai and Tetgales, who had just arrived there, on their return from
the Sea of Kara through Yugorsky Shar (Pet’s Strait), to which, with pardonable national
vanity, they had given the name of the Strait of Nassau. Their report was that they
had sailed fifty or sixty Dutch miles (200 or 240 geographical miles) to the eastward
of that strait, and in their opinion had reached about the longitude of the river
Ob, and were not far from Cape Tabin (Taimur), the furthest point of Tartary, whence
the coast trended to the south-east, and afterwards to the south, towards the kingdom
of Cathay.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2492src" href="#xd33e2492" title="Go to note 109.">109</a>
</p>
<p>After much rejoicing on both sides at their happy meeting, the whole fleet now sailed
homewards in company, and on the 14th of September came to the Doggers Sand, whence
Nai, in the Swan, proceeded to Middelburg, whilst the other vessels passed by the
Texel to their several ports.
</p>
<p>The reports made by Barents and Linschoten of the results of their respective voyages
were very different in character. The former, though anything but an illiterate man,
could make no pretensions to scholarship. The latter <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxi">[<a href="#pbcxi">cxi</a>]</span>was an accomplished scholar, as is plainly shown by his narrative of this first and
of the second voyage (which will be more particularly noticed in the sequel), and
by his other published works; and though the vessels which he accompanied had not
in reality accomplished so much as those of Barents, yet he appears to have had no
difficulty in convincing their employers and the higher authorities that they had
been not far from the realisation of the object of their voyage.
</p>
<p>That, in the estimation of the Amsterdammers, Linschoten represented matters in too
favourable a light, is manifest from Gerrit de Veer’s innuendo at the commencement
of his description of the second voyage, that he “de saeck vry wat breedt voort stelde,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2502src" href="#xd33e2502" title="Go to note 110.">110</a> which caused Linschoten to reply that, whether he had done so or not, he left to
the judgment of the discreet reader.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2505src" href="#xd33e2505" title="Go to note 111.">111</a>
</p>
<p>Our present knowledge of those seas enables us to judge the question fairly and impartially
between the two, and to decide that, when at the Islands of Orange, Barents had sailed
from Kildin, their point of separation, further in a direct line, and made a more
easterly longitude, than Nai and Tetgales had when at their furthest point on the
eastern side of the Sea of Kara; and that, when there, he was quite as near as they
were to the mouth of the Ob, and <i>as near again to Cape Taimur</i>; with the certainty, further, that from the former position a passage eastwards would
at most times, if not always, be attended with fewer difficulties than from the latter.
And it cannot be denied that Linschoten, in stating as he does on the title-page of
his work, and at the commencement of his Introduction, without any <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxii">[<a href="#pbcxii">cxii</a>]</span>qualification, that he “sailed through the Strait of Nassau to <i>beyond the river Oby</i>,” has certainly afforded a justification for De Veer’s imputation that he represented
matters “vry wat breedt.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2518src" href="#xd33e2518" title="Go to note 112.">112</a>
</p>
<p>Stimulated by Linschoten’s report, the adventurers who had fitted out the former expedition,
with others who now joined them, determined on dispatching in the following year a
large and well-appointed fleet, not merely in the hope of accomplishing the passage
to China which had been so well commenced, but also with a view to the establishment
of an advantageous trade with that kingdom, and the other countries that might be
discovered and visited in the course of the voyage, in respect of which trade they
obtained from the Government of the United Provinces certain exclusive privileges
and advantages.
</p>
<p>This fleet consisted of seven vessels, namely, two from Zeelandt, two from Enkhuysen,
two from Amsterdam (which city, in consequence of the want of success of Barents’s
first voyage by Novaya Zemlya, was now willing to take part in the undertaking of
the other ports), and one from Rotterdam. The following are the names of the vessels
and of their commanders. The Griffin (<i lang="nl">Griffoen</i>), of Zeelandt, of the burthen of 100 lasts (200 tons), commanded by Cornelis Cornelisz.
Nai, who was appointed admiral or superintendent of the fleet; the Swan (<i lang="nl">Swane</i>), also of Zeelandt, of the burthen of 50 lasts (100 tons), which had been on the
former voyage, and was now commanded by Lambert Gerritsz. Oom, of Enkhuysen; the Hope
(<i lang="nl">Hoope</i>), of Enkhuysen, a new war-pinnace (<span lang="nl">oorlogspinas</span>) of 100 lasts, commanded by Brant Ysbrantsz. Tetgales, vice-admiral; the Mercury
(<i lang="nl">Mercurius</i>), of Enkhuysen, of 50 lasts, which had been on the former voyage, and was now commanded
by Thomas Willemszoon; the Greyhound (<i lang="nl">Winthont</i>), of Amsterdam, likewise a new war-pinnace, <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxiii">[<a href="#pbcxiii">cxiii</a>]</span>of 100 lasts, commanded by William Barents, pilot-major of the fleet, under whom was
Cornelis Jacobszoon as skipper;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2546src" href="#xd33e2546" title="Go to note 113.">113</a> a yacht<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2549src" href="#xd33e2549" title="Go to note 114.">114</a> of Amsterdam, of 50 lasts (probably the Mercury of the former voyage), commanded
by Harman Janszoon; and lastly, a yacht of Rotterdam, of about 20 lasts, or 40 tons
burthen, commanded by Hendrick Hartman. The last-named vessel was commissioned, when
the fleet should have reached Cape Tabin, or so far that it might thence continue
its course southwards without hindrance from the ice, to return and bring news of
their success to Holland. The vessels were all well equipped, with a double complement
of men, and ammunition and victuals for a year and a half. The interpreter of the
fleet was Meester Christoffel Splindler, as on the former voyage. As supercargoes
on behalf of the merchants of Holland and West Friesland, were Jan Huyghen van Linschoten,
Jacob van Heemskerck, and Jan Cornelisz. Rijp; and for those of Zeelandt, François
de la Dale and N. Buys, with some other relatives of Balthazar Moucheron. Linschoten
and De la Dale were further appointed chief commissioners of the fleet on behalf of
his excellency prince Maurice and the States General, from whom they received the
following commission:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first hangIndent"><span class="sc">Instructions</span> <i>to Jan Huygen van Linschoten and Françoys de la Dale, Chief Commissioners, for the
regulation of their conduct in the kingdom of China, and other kingdoms and countries

</p>
<p>In the first place, after Mr. Christoffel Splindler, the Slavonian, shall have been
on shore and ascertained whether they may land there, they shall go on shore to the
king, governor, <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxiv">[<a href="#pbcxiv">cxiv</a>]</span>or other authority of the place, to whom they shall, on behalf of these States, offer
all friendship, and shall explain the circumstances of these States, namely, that
they hold communication by sea with all countries and nations in the whole world,
for the purpose of trafficking, trading, and dealing with them in a friendly and upright
manner, for which they possess many advantages of divers sorts of merchandise and
otherwise.
</p>
<p>Item, that the Government of this Country being surely informed that upright trade,
traffic, and dealings are carried on in the said kingdoms and countries, have found
it good to send thither some ships, under good order, government, and regulation,
with merchandise, money, and other commodities, in order to begin dealings, by means
of certain trusty and honest persons on board the said ships, for whom they shall
ask free intercourse there, to the end aforesaid.
</p>
<p>They shall do their best to come to an agreement for a fair, faithful, upright, and
uninterrupted trade, traffic, and navigation, to the mutual advantage of the said
kingdoms and of these States, as well as of their respective inhabitants; and in case
the same shall be found good there, they shall declare that to that end it is intended
to visit them with a good embassy by the first opportunity, provided the same shall
be agreeable to them.
</p>
<p>They shall explain there what commodities and merchandizes can from time to time be
taken thither from these States; and they shall also carefully examine so as to ascertain
what merchandizes and wares may, in return for the same, be obtained from those kingdoms
and countries and brought to these States.
</p>
<p>They shall keep a good and accurate account of everything that shall occur during
the voyage, as well on ship-board, in the discovery of countries and ports, and on
all other occasions, as likewise of that which shall happen to them on shore; so that,

<span class="pageNum" id="pbcxv">[<a href="#pbcxv">cxv</a>]</span></p>
<p>The several vessels composing the fleet having assembled at the Texel, they all sailed
out of Mars Diep on the morning of Sunday, the 2d of July, 1595. It was not till the
10th of August that they passed the North Cape, and on the 17th they fell in with
ice, being then about fifty miles distant from the coast of Novaya Zemlya. On the
following day they reached the island of “Matfloe”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2593src" href="#xd33e2593" title="Go to note 116.">116</a> and on the 19th came to the mouth of the strait to the south of Vaigats Island (Yugorsky
Shar), where they found the ice to lie in such quantities, “that the entire channel
was closed up as far as the eye could see, so that it had the appearance of a continent,
which was most frightful to behold”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2596src" href="#xd33e2596" title="Go to note 117.">117</a> Under these circumstances they scarcely knew how to act, but at length resolved to
go into the roadstead called Train-oil Bay (<i lang="nl">Traenbay</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2601src" href="#xd33e2601" title="Go to note 118.">118</a>), where, as it was under the shelter of Idol Cape (<i lang="nl"><span class="corr" id="xd33e2605" title="Source: Afyoden">Afgoden</span> Hoeck</i>), and thus out of the current which set from the strait, there was a little open
water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2609src" href="#xd33e2609" title="Go to note 119.">119</a> The preceding winter appears to have been more than ordinarily severe, and the ice-masses
set in motion by the summer’s sun were consequently far greater in quantity than usual.
This, coupled with the late period of the year at which, from some unexplained cause,
they had commenced their voyage, soon convinced them that they had but little prospect
of being able to get forward. On the 20th August, while thus lying in Train-oil Bay,
a council was held on board the admiral’s ship, when it was decided that a yacht should
be sent to examine the condition of the strait and the probability of their getting
through, and also that a party of thirty or forty armed men should proceed across
the Island of Vaigats for the same purpose. The yacht could go no further than Cross
Point, where the entire sea was found to be covered with ice without the least break
or <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxvi">[<a href="#pbcxvi">cxvi</a>]</span>opening; but the crew thence proceeded by land as far as Cape Dispute, though without
better success. The party of men—whom De Veer describes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2615src" href="#xd33e2615" title="Go to note 120.">120</a> as fifty-four in number, himself included—returned with a somewhat more favourable
report; for they thought they had discovered a practicable passage, because they saw
so little ice there.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2618src" href="#xd33e2618" title="Go to note 121.">121</a> In this their experience agreed with that of Pet and Jackman, who found a passage
close along the shore, between the ice and the land, at times when the deep sea was
entirely filled with ice-masses.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2622src" href="#xd33e2622" title="Go to note 122.">122</a>
</p>
<p>On the 24th of August a yacht was again sent out to inspect the strait, and got as
far as Cross Point, bringing back the <span class="corr" id="xd33e2629" title="Source: consolatary">consolatory</span> intelligence that the ice was beginning to move, and that all was clear, with open
water, as far as Cape Dispute. On the following day therefore the fleet weighed anchor,
and sailed as far as beyond the latter cape, without meeting with any ice; but soon
afterwards they fell in with such quantities that they were forced to return. That
night they anchored between Cape Dispute and Cross Point, and on the following day
betook themselves to their former station under Idol Cape, “there to stay for a more
convenient time.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2632src" href="#xd33e2632" title="Go to note 123.">123</a> Here they were so entirely surrounded by the ice, that they could walk dry-foot from
one ship to the other.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2635src" href="#xd33e2635" title="Go to note 124.">124</a>
</p>
<p>The admiral and other officers had now evidently given up all hopes of effecting a
passage, to which result the murmurings of the crews may perhaps have contributed.
Barents, however, with that determination and perseverance for which he appears to
have been distinguished, was not so satisfied as they were that nothing more could
be done; and as on the 30th of August the ice began again to move, he, on the following
day, had a good many words with the admiral on the subject,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2640src" href="#xd33e2640" title="Go to note 125.">125</a> after which he in person crossed <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxvii">[<a href="#pbcxvii">cxvii</a>]</span>over the strait to the main land of the Samoyedes, where he made inquiries of the
natives. On his return the following day, he again “spake to the admirall to will
him to set sayle, that they might goe forward; but they had not so many wordes together
as was betweene them the day before.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2645src" href="#xd33e2645" title="Go to note 126.">126</a> The conversation which ensued is quaintly told by De Veer, and with an air of perfect
truthfulness. On the following morning (September 2nd), a little before sun-rise,
Barents began to warp his vessel out, when Nai and Tetgales, on seeing him do so,
“began also to hoyse their anchors and to set sayle.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2648src" href="#xd33e2648" title="Go to note 127.">127</a> The result of this movement was, that, with immense labour and difficulty and no
little danger, they succeeded in making their way through the ice as far as States
Island, which they reached in the evening of the 3rd September; sailing on the following
morning a little further along the channel between that island and the mainland, so
as to be sheltered from the drifting of the ice.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2652src" href="#xd33e2652" title="Go to note 128.">128</a>
</p>
<p>This was virtually the termination of their voyage. On the following day (September
4th) a council was held on board the admiral’s ship, when it was decided that, “in
order not to fail in their duty,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2658src" href="#xd33e2658" title="Go to note 129.">129</a>—which means that it was little more than a matter of form,—they should on the following
day make one more endeavour to get through the ice; and if they did not succeed, that
then they should not attempt it any further, seeing that the time was passing rapidly,
and the winter, with its dreadful cold and long nights, was on the point of setting
in. “For,” adds Linschoten,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2663src" href="#xd33e2663" title="Go to note 130.">130</a> “it is now sufficiently clear and manifest that it does not please the Lord God to
permit us this time to proceed further on our voyage of discovery, so that it is not
<span class="pageNum" id="pbcxviii">[<a href="#pbcxviii">cxviii</a>]</span>fitting that we should wilfully tempt Him any longer and run with our heads against
the wall.”
</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that Nai and his companions were beset with great difficulties,
and that any further attempts might have been extremely hazardous. The crews too of
the vessels were now louder in their murmurs, and complained that their commanders
desired their deaths, inasmuch as being surrounded by the ice, they ran the chance
of remaining locked up during the whole winter;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2670src" href="#xd33e2670" title="Go to note 131.">131</a> added to which, the loss of two men, who were killed by a bear on the 6th of September,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2673src" href="#xd33e2673" title="Go to note 132.">132</a> was not at all unlikely to augment the panic, and to cause insubordination among
the survivors.
</p>
<p>Finding the sea to continue quite full of ice, a council was again held on the 8th
September on board the admiral’s ship, in order to determine finally whether they
should proceed or return, whereon a great debate took place.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2678src" href="#xd33e2678" title="Go to note 133.">133</a> Most of them were of opinion that they should at once return. To this however, the
Amsterdammers were opposed, their opinion being that some of them should volunteer
to remain there with two of the vessels during the winter, and take their chance of
the wintering, besides seeing whether they could not manage to get through, or else
trying whether they might not be able to make their way to the west of Vaigats, and
so round by the north of Novaya Zemlya. But it was replied, that the time for doing
so was past, and that moreover it did not accord with their instructions. Nevertheless,
if they wished it, they could do it of their own authority, and then see how they
might afterwards answer for their conduct.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2683src" href="#xd33e2683" title="Go to note 134.">134</a>
</p>
<p>On the following day the indefatigable Barents “went on shoare on the south side of
the States Iland, and layd a <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxix">[<a href="#pbcxix">cxix</a>]</span>stone on the brinke of the water, to proue whether there were a tide, and went round
about the iland to shoote at a hare; and returning”—as he says in the only writing
undoubtedly of his original composition which has been preserved to us—“I found the
stone as I left it, and the water neither higher nor lower; which prooueth, as afore,
that there is no flood nor ebbe.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2690src" href="#xd33e2690" title="Go to note 135.">135</a>
</p>
<p>He could scarcely have returned on board before the fleet set sail from States Island,
on their return to the strait; but the ice came in so thick and with such force, that
they could not get through, and therefore had to put back in the evening.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2695src" href="#xd33e2695" title="Go to note 136.">136</a> Next day, however, they succeeded in again reaching Cape Dispute, where they anchored.
</p>
<p>On the 11th, it was decided that they should once more sail towards the ice, for the
purpose of removing all doubts as to the impossibility of proceeding; but they had
not sailed three hours before they reached the firm ice, which stretched round in
all <span class="corr" id="xd33e2700" title="Source: directione">directions</span>, completely preventing all further passage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2703src" href="#xd33e2703" title="Go to note 137.">137</a> They therefore returned and anchored at Cross Point, where they remained till the
morning of the 14th, when Barents weighed his anchor and set his top mast, thinking
once again to try what he could do to further his voyage; but the admiral, being of
another mind, lay still till the 15th of September.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2707src" href="#xd33e2707" title="Go to note 138.">138</a>
</p>
<p>On that day, as Linschoten relates in no very courteous language, “seeing how the
weather had set in, the Amsterdammers thought better of the matter, and let their
obstinacy somewhat abate (lieten hun obstinaetheyt wat sincken), agreeing to conform
with all the rest.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2713src" href="#xd33e2713" title="Go to note 139.">139</a> The following protest, which had been drawn up by Linschoten, was accordingly signed
by Barents together with the other officers,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2716src" href="#xd33e2716" title="Go to note 140.">140</a> and the <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxx">[<a href="#pbcxx">cxx</a>]</span>same day the whole fleet sailed out from the west end of the strait homeward bound.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">PROTEST.
</p>
<p>On this day, the 15th of September, 1595, in the country and in the roads of the Cross
Point, in the Strait of Nassau, where the ships are now lying at anchor all together,
by desire and command of the admiral, Cornelis Cornelisz., the captains or pilots
of all the aforesaid ships being assembled and met together in the cabin of the ship
of the said admiral, in order that, jointly and each of them severally, they may without
dissimulation and freely declare their opinion and final decision, and so consult
together as to what is best and most advantageous to be done and undertaken in respect
of the voyage which they have commenced round by the north towards China, Japan, etc.;
and they having maturely and most earnestly considered and examined the subject, and
also desiring strictly to carry out, as far as is practicable and possible, the instructions
of His Excellency and the Lords the States, for the welfare and preservation of the
same ships, their crews and merchandize: It is found that they have all of them hitherto
done their utmost duty and their best, with all zeal and diligence, not fearing to
hazard and sometimes to put in peril the ships and their own persons (whenever need
required it), in order to preserve their honour in everything, and so as to be able
with a clear conscience to answer for the same to God and to the whole world. But
inasmuch as it has pleased the Lord God not to permit it on the present voyage, they
find themselves most unwillingly compelled, because of the time that has elapsed,
to discontinue the same navigation for this time, being prevented by the ice caused
by the severe and unusually long frost, which, from what they have heard on the information
of others and from their own experience, has this year been very hard and extraordinary
in these parts. All which having been well considered and discussed by them together,
they find no better means, being forced by necessity, than, with the first fit weather
and favourable <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxi">[<a href="#pbcxxi">cxxi</a>]</span>wind, to take their course homewards, all together and in the order in which they
came, using every diligence so as if possible to preserve themselves from the frost
which is momentarily expected to set in, and with God’s help to bring the ships, before
all the perils of winter, into a safe harbour; inasmuch as at the present time no
other better means can be found to lead them to a better judgment. Protesting before
God and the whole world, that they have acted in this matter as they wish God may
act in the salvation of their souls, and as they hope and trust cannot be gainsaid
or controverted by any of those who have accompanied them; and they willingly submit
themselves to defend this at all times, if requisite, by means of the fuller and more
detailed journals and notes, which each of them, separately and without communication
with the others, has kept thereof. And in order that there may be no disorder or idle
talking unjustly spread abroad, to the disadvantage or derogation of those who with
such good will have braved so many perils for the honour and advantage of our country,
whereby they might be deprived of their merited reward, they have, for their defence
and in order to provide before hand against the same, unanimously signed this Act,
which I, Ian Huyghen van Linschoten, have drawn up at their request, and together
with Françoys de la Dale, as chief commissioners of the said fleet, have, with the
like affirmation and in further corroboration, in like manner signed, the day and
date above written.

</p>
<p>It may well be conceived that it was no easy task for a bold and resolute sailor,
and at the same time a devout and conscientious man, as William Barents undoubtedly
was, to “protest before God, as he wished He might act in the salvation of his soul”,
that it was impossible for him to do more than he had done, so long as his ship was
staunch <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxii">[<a href="#pbcxxii">cxxii</a>]</span>and he had a crew willing to go forward with him, or even to brave a winter residence
in those inhospitable regions. Linschoten speaks of the dissentient Amsterdammers
in the plural number; whence it is to be inferred that Barents did not stand alone,
but that Harmen Ianszoon, the master of the other Amsterdam vessel, was at first of
the same opinion; and, most probably, it was only when he yielded, that Barents saw
himself, however reluctantly, forced to give in.
</p>
<p>After the protest had been so signed, the fleet proceeded on its homeward voyage,
and on the 30th of September reached Wardhuus, where it remained till the 10th of
the following month. The vessels then again set sail all together; but the vice-admiral’s
ship, the Hope, on board of which was Linschoten, managed to get the start of the
rest, arriving at the Texel on the 26th of October. It was not till the 18th of the
following month that Barents’s vessel arrived in the river Maas.
</p>
<p>The journal of the proceedings of the fleet, which was kept by Linschoten in pursuance
of his instructions, was communicated by him to the Government immediately on his
arrival; but it was not till six years afterwards that he published his very interesting
and valuable narrative of this voyage, as well as of that of the preceding year so
far as concerns the Enkhuysen vessels, which had sailed through Yugorsky Shar—“Pet’s
Strait” or the “Strait of Nassau”—into the Sea of Kara.
</p>
<p>So little appears to be known by bibliographers respecting Linschoten’s narrative
of these voyages, that we have scarcely the means of describing any other editions
than those which happen to exist in the British Museum.
</p>
<p>The earliest of these appeared in Dutch, in 1601, in folio, under the following title:—

<p>This rare edition consists of thirty-eight numbered leaves, with a dedication to the
States General, dated June 1st, 1601, on two leaves unnumbered, and contains numerous
maps and coast views by Johannes and Baptista a Doetechum. It was reprinted at Amsterdam
in 1624, likewise in folio, with the same plates.
</p>
<p>In the first edition, between the dedication and the text, are inserted several eulogistic
poems, the longest of which is an ode on “<span lang="nl">Vaygats ofte de Straet van Nassau</span>”, by C. Taemssoon van Hoorn, and another is a “<span lang="nl">Lof-dicht</span>”, by Jacobus Viverius, which is directed to be sung to the tune of the forty-second
Psalm. It is worthy of remark, that, even so early as 1595, allusion was made to the
first north-east voyage of Linschoten in the commendatory verses (which included also
the poem on Vaygats above referred to) at the commencement of the “<span lang="nl">Reys-gheschrift van de Navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten.….….door Jan Huyghen
van Linschoten. Amstelredam, <span class="sc">MDXCV.</span> folio</span>”; which work, though it bears the date of 1595, the register shows to be a portion
of the author’s “<span lang="nl">Itinerario, Voyage ofte Schipvaert van Jan Huygen van Linschoten naer Oost <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxiv">[<a href="#pbcxxiv">cxxiv</a>]</span>ofte Portugaels Indien</span>”, the title-page of which is dated a year later. This was reprinted in 1604 with
the same verses.
</p>
<p>An abstract in Dutch of Linschoten’s narrative was printed at Amsterdam by G.&nbsp;J. Saeghman,
in 4to., with the following title:—
</p>

</p>
<p>This has no date, but was probably printed in or about 1663, the year in which Saeghman
printed the “<span lang="nl">Verhael van de vier eerste Schip-vaerden der Hollandtsche en Zeeuwsche Schepen naar

of Gerrit de Veer’s work.

<p>We learn from Mr. Henry Stevens that a copy of this abstract is in the possession
of John Carter Brown, Esq., of Providence, Rhode Island.

</p>
<p>Although the voyages to the north are thus announced in the title-page, they are not
inserted in the only copy which we have been able to consult, namely, that in the
British Museum; nor is any light thrown on the matter by bibliographers.
</p>
<p>In the title of the third edition, published at Amsterdam in 1638, fol., these northern
voyages are not announced, nor are they given, but the edition is described as “<span lang="fr">troixiesme édition augmentée</span>”.
</p>
<p>The second French edition has not fallen within our reach, but we believe the date
to be 1619.
</p>
<p>The only French version of Linschoten’s narrative of his northern voyages with which
we are acquainted, is that inserted in the fourth volume of the “<span lang="fr">Recueil de Voiages au Nord</span>”, published in eight volumes, Amsterdam, 1715–27, 12mo.; of which another edition,
in ten volumes, 12mo., was published at the same place, 1731–38.
</p>
<p>This French version formed the basis of the German description of these voyages given
by Johann <span class="corr" id="xd33e2840" title="Source: Cristoph">Christoph</span> Adelung, at pp. 107–213 of his <i lang="de">Geschichte der Schiffahrten</i>, published at Halle, 1768, 4to.
</p>
<p>An abstract of Linschoten’s work is given in Latin, at fol. 31 of the first volume
of Blaeu’s “<span lang="la">Atlas Major sive Cosmographia Blaviana, qua Solum, Salum, Cœlum accuratissime describuntur</span>”. Eleven volumes in folio, Amsterdam, 1662.
</p>
<p>In the French edition, entitled “<span lang="fr">Le Grand Atlas ou <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxvi">[<a href="#pbcxxvi">cxxvi</a>]</span>Cosmographie Blaviane</span>”, etc., 12 vols. in folio, Amsterdam, 1663, and republished in 1667, the same appears
at fol. 35 of the first volume of the latter edition, which is the only one in the
British Museum.
</p>
<p>It is also at fol. 52 of the first volume of the Spanish edition, entitled “<span lang="es">Atlas Mayor, Geographia Blaviana</span>”, etc.; Amsterdam, 1659–72, 10 vols., fol.
</p>
<p>In the elaborate dissertation on the works of John Blaeu, contained in the fourth
volume of Clement’s “<span lang="fr">Bibliothèque Curieuse</span>”, mention is made, at page 277, of an “<span lang="fr">Atlas <i>Flamand</i> de l’an 1662</span>”. This is apparently a Dutch edition, to which reference is made by Lütke, under
the title of “<span lang="nl">J. Blaeu’s Grooten Atlas, of Werelt Beschrijving, Erste Deel, ’t Amsterdam, 1662</span>”. Beyond this reference, we know nothing of that edition.
</p>
<p>A German edition is also described by Brunet as announced in a catalogue of Blaeu’s;
but it is not alluded to by Clement, nor can we find any other trace of it. If ever
printed or in progress of printing, it may have been consumed in the great fire, by
which, on the 22nd February, 1672, nearly all Blaeu’s stock in trade was destroyed.
</p>
<p>In part <span class="sc">XII</span>, pp. 20–23, of Levinus Hulsius’s Collection, is an extract from Linschoten’s Navigation,
stating the progress of the Dutch in the attempt to find the passage, the discovery
of which formed a favourite scheme of his countrymen at the end of the sixteenth and
beginning of the seventeenth centuries.
</p>
<p>Summaries more or less concise, derived apparently from Blaeu’s abstract, the French
“<span lang="fr">Recueil de Voyages au Nord</span>”, or Adelung’s “<span lang="de">Geschichte der Schiffahrten</span>”, have also been given in most of the histories of Arctic discovery.
</p>
<p>Gerrit de Veer’s description of the second voyage, contained in the present volume,
must be understood to relate almost exclusively to the proceedings of Barents’s vessel,
as forming one of the fleet under Nai’s command. This reconciles <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxvii">[<a href="#pbcxxvii">cxxvii</a>]</span>or explains away such differences as may appear to exist between his narrative and
that of Linschoten.
</p>
<p>Seeing the signal failure of the second expedition, the States General, after mature
deliberation, decided that no further attempt should be made at the public expense
to discover a north-east passage. Nevertheless, they were still willing to encourage
any private undertaking, by the promise of a considerable reward in the event of success.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2897src" href="#xd33e2897" title="Go to note 141.">141</a> And Plantius and Barents persisting in their opinion that a passage might be effected
by the north of Novaya Zemlya, the authorities and merchants of Amsterdam were induced
to take on themselves the fitting out of another expedition to proceed in that direction.
It consisted of only two vessels—the names and tonnage of which are not mentioned—of
which the one was commanded by Jacob van Heemskerck, who was also supercargo, and
the other by Jan Corneliszoon Rijp, in the like double capacity. Barents accompanied
Heemskerck, with the rank of chief pilot (opperste stuerman). Surprise has been expressed
that though Barents thus occupied a subordinate station, yet in the narrative of the
voyage he is made to perform the principal part. This is, however, a mistake, arising
from the fact that in the abridgements and summaries of this narrative, which alone
appear to have been consulted by modern writers, most of the personal matters are
omitted. For it will be seen that in De Veer’s original work, the skipper (or “maister”,
as he is called in Phillip’s translation) is repeatedly mentioned, and <span class="corr" id="xd33e2900" title="Source: Barent’s">Barents’</span> subordinate position is clearly and unequivocally shown.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2903src" href="#xd33e2903" title="Go to note 142.">142</a>
</p>
<p>A better founded cause of surprise might be, that Barents himself had not the command
of the expedition. Yet for this a sufficient reason suggests itself. He was evidently
resolved to perform (as it were) impossibilities, rather than fail in a project on
which he had set his heart; and the <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxviii">[<a href="#pbcxxviii">cxxviii</a>]</span>merchants, however willing to risk their property on the adventure, may naturally
have been disinclined to entrust it absolutely to one, who would not have hesitated
to sacrifice it, or even his own life, in the attempt to accomplish his long-cherished
undertaking.
</p>
<p>In being made subordinate to a nobleman like Jacob van Heemskerck, who, though no
seaman by profession, had already sailed with him, and had thus had an opportunity
of learning and appreciating his many estimable qualities, Barents, a man of humble
birth, could however in no wise have felt himself humiliated or aggrieved. It was
a case similar to that of Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor, and was moreover
quite in accordance with the practice of those times, which afford repeated instances
of the command of a naval expedition being entrusted to a soldier, who had probably
never before been on salt water.
</p>
<p>But while Heemskerck thus held the superior rank of captain, Barents’s relation to
him was evidently that of an equal, rather than that of an inferior. This is particularly
evidenced in the conversation which took place between them shortly before Barents’s
death, when the latter called his nominal commander “mate”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2913src" href="#xd33e2913" title="Go to note 143.">143</a> And that the crew looked on Barents as virtually the leader of the expedition is
shown, not only by their appeals to him on all important occasions, but by the curious
fact that in the signatures to the “letter” which they wrote on the eve of their departure
from their winter quarters,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2916src" href="#xd33e2916" title="Go to note 144.">144</a> the name “<span class="sc">WILLEM BARENTSZ</span>.” is printed in capital letters, while that of Heemskerck, though placed in rank
above Barents’s name, is only in ordinary type, like those of the rest of the crew.
</p>
<p>We have now to take a rapid glance at some of the most important results of this third
voyage, into the particulars of which, as they are recorded in De Veer’s journal,
it is unnecessary to enter.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxix">[<a href="#pbcxxix">cxxix</a>]</span></p>
<p>The experience of the two former voyages appears to have impressed Rijp, even more
than Barents himself, with the expediency of giving the land to the east a wide sea
room; for, notwithstanding that they at first steered their course much more to the
northward than before, yet it was not long before disputes arose between them, Barents
contending that they were too far to the west, while Rijp’s pilot asserted that he
had no desire to sail towards Vaigats.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2928src" href="#xd33e2928" title="Go to note 145.">145</a> Barents gave way; and the result was, that on the 9th of June they came to a small
steep island, in latitude 74° 30′, to which they gave the name of Bear Island, from
the circumstance of their killing there a large white bear.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2931src" href="#xd33e2931" title="Go to note 146.">146</a>
</p>
<p>Seven years later this island was visited by Stephen Bennet, who called it Cherie
Island, after his patron, Master (subsequently Sir) Francis Cherie, a distinguished
member of the Russian Company. This latter name has usually been inscribed in our
English maps, though unjustly, inasmuch as the merit of the first discovery of the
island unquestionably belongs to the Dutch. Captain Beechey says, indeed, that “a
passage in Purchas seems to imply that it had been known before Barents made this
voyage;”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2937src" href="#xd33e2937" title="Go to note 147.">147</a> but the only passage bearing on the subject which we have been able to find, is the
statement of Captain Thomas Edge, in “A briefe Discouerie of the Northern Discoueries
of Seas,” etc., that the Dutch came “to an iland in the latitude of 74 degrees, which
<i>wee call</i> Cherie Iland, and they call Beare Iland,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2943src" href="#xd33e2943" title="Go to note 148.">148</a> as if the former name had been given before the latter. It is to be hoped that in
future English maps, the original and correct name will always be inserted.
</p>
<p>From Bear Island our adventurers continued their course northwards, and on the 19th
of June, when in latitude 79° 49′ N., they again saw land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2949src" href="#xd33e2949" title="Go to note 149.">149</a> which was supposed by them <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxx">[<a href="#pbcxxx">cxxx</a>]</span>to be a part of Greenland, but which subsequent investigation has shown to be the
cluster of islands known by the name of Spitzbergen. Round this land they coasted
till the 29th, when they again sailed southwards towards Bear Island.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2954src" href="#xd33e2954" title="Go to note 150.">150</a>
</p>
<p>The first discovery of this country by our Dutch navigators is now universally admitted,
though formerly the idea was entertained that they had been anticipated by Sir Hugh
Willoughby. But that Spitzbergen was actually <i>circumnavigated</i> by them is a fact which, as far as we are aware, has never been adverted to by any
writer on Arctic discovery. The details of this portion of <span class="corr" id="xd33e2961" title="Source: Barents">Barents’</span> and Rijp’s voyage are neither full nor precise enough to enable us to follow them
minutely in their course; added to which, the maps of Spitzbergen, especially of its
eastern side, are still not sufficiently trustworthy to render us much assistance
in laying down their track. There can, however, be no doubt that they sailed up its
eastern shores, passed along its northern extremity, and returned by the western coast.
That part of Spitzbergen which they first saw in 79° 49′ N. lat., seems to be the
south-east coast of the Noord Ooster Land of the Dutch maps, along which they sailed
in a westerly direction, and entered Weygatz or Hinlopen Strait. This assumption agrees
with the above latitude and with those of the subsequent positions in 79° 30′<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2964src" href="#xd33e2964" title="Go to note 151.">151</a> and 79° 42′,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2968src" href="#xd33e2968" title="Go to note 152.">152</a> as also with the time it took—several days—to get out of that strait. The two havens
described under the date of June 24th,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2972src" href="#xd33e2972" title="Go to note 153.">153</a> may be the Hecla Bay and Lomme Bay of Parry. The considerable bay or inlet (gheweldigen
inham) under 79°, to which they came on the following day, and “whereinto they sailed
forty miles at the least, holding their course southward”,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2977src" href="#xd33e2977" title="Go to note 154.">154</a> can only be Weide Bay. Finding that its southern extremity “reached to the firme
land”, they were forced to <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxi">[<a href="#pbcxxxi">cxxxi</a>]</span>work their way back against the wind, till they “gate beyonde the point that lay on
the west side, where there was so great a number of birds that they flew against their
sailes”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2983src" href="#xd33e2983" title="Go to note 155.">155</a> This point, in consequence, received the name of Bird Cape. From thence their course
is plainly to be traced along the western coast of Spitzbergen, and so back to Bear
Island.
</p>
<p>On the 1st of June, when near that island, disputes again arose between Rijp and Barents
as to the course which they should take. The result was that they separated, Rijp
returning northwards, while Barents proceeded southwards because of the ice.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2988src" href="#xd33e2988" title="Go to note 156.">156</a>
</p>
<p>Of Rijp’s subsequent proceedings nothing is known except that he is stated to have
sailed back to Bird Cape, on the west side of Spitzbergen, whence he returned with
the intention of going after Barents.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e2993src" href="#xd33e2993" title="Go to note 157.">157</a> How far he carried his <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxii">[<a href="#pbcxxxii">cxxxii</a>]</span>intention into effect is not said; but nothing worthy of remark can have occurred
to him, or otherwise it could not have failed to be recorded. We may therefore conclude
<span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxiii">[<a href="#pbcxxxiii">cxxxiii</a>]</span>that he soon gave up his search after Barents and returned to Holland, and that, in
the following year, he went from thence on a trading voyage to the coasts of Norway
or Russia, and was on the point of sailing from Kola on his way home, when Heemskerck
and the survivors of his crew arrived there, as is related by De Veer.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3073src" href="#xd33e3073" title="Go to note 158.">158</a>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Barents, having cleared the ice, held on his course to the east till he
reached the western shore of Novaya Zemlya, in about latitude 73° 20′,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3078src" href="#xd33e3078" title="Go to note 159.">159</a> whence he coasted along the land till he had passed considerably beyond the furthest
point reached by him on his first voyage, and had rounded the north-eastern extremity
of that country. Here, being at length quite shut in by the ice, and unable to make
his way either forwards towards the north-east, or round by the eastern side of the
land, or even back again by the way he had come, he and his adventurous companions,
on the evening of the 26th of August, “got to the west side of the <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxiv">[<a href="#pbcxxxiv">cxxxiv</a>]</span>Ice Haven, where they were forced, in great cold, poverty, misery, and grief, to stay
all that winter.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3083src" href="#xd33e3083" title="Go to note 160.">160</a>
</p>
<p>Before adverting to the subject of the memorable wintering of the Dutch at this spot,
it is necessary to make a few remarks with respect to the identification of the several
points along the coast, which were reached and noted by them during the course of
their first and third voyages. This is the more needful, because widely different
opinions are entertained by two of the highest living authorities on the subject,
Admiral <span class="corr" id="xd33e3088" title="Source: Lutke">Lütke</span> and Professor von Baer.
</p>
<p>The former, as is well known, was engaged in surveying the Northern Ocean between
the years 1821 and 1825, during which period he visited many parts of the western
coast of Novaya Zemlya between its southern extremity and Cape Nassau to the north,
and identified most of the points visited by the Dutch, which he laid down in the
map accompanying the published account of his four voyages, to the German translation
of which allusion has already been made. Professor von Baer, on the other hand, who
also made a scientific visit to Novaya Zemlya in the year 1837, read in the preceeding
year, before the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, a “Report of the
latest Discoveries on the Coast of Novaya Zemlya”, an illustration of a map of that
country constructed by a pilot in the Russian navy, named Zivolka; of which report
a German translation is published in Berghaus’s “Annalen der Erd-Vôlker- und Staatenkunde.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3093src" href="#xd33e3093" title="Go to note 161.">161</a>
</p>
<p>In this report the learned Professor comes to widely different conclusions from those
of Lütke with respect to the identification of the several stations visited by the
Dutch; the great point of difference between them being, that Baer bases his arguments
almost exclusively on the distances along the western coast of Novaya Zemlya recorded
by De <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxv">[<a href="#pbcxxxv">cxxxv</a>]</span>Veer, especially in the Table given near the end of his third voyage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3100src" href="#xd33e3100" title="Go to note 162.">162</a>
</p>
<p>This Table, however, we cannot but regard as little better than a mere <i>list</i> of the various stations reached by the Dutch on their return voyage; the distances,
and even the bearings, therein recorded, being quite untrustworthy, as may indeed
be perceived on the most cursory inspection. Every allowance has, of course, to be
made for any inaccuracies that may exist in that Table, in consideration of the circumstances
under which the return voyage was made; but, even were we to assume the distances
sailed by them in their two small open boats to have been correctly noted down, still
there is a sufficient reason for contending that those distances, in themselves, are
no sure guide, but, on the contrary, only lead to very erroneous conclusions. For,
on a comparison of them with the differences of latitude recorded by De Veer,—which,
as being the results of astronomical observations made by so experienced a navigator
as Barents was, are subject only to the imperfections of the instruments employed
by him,—it will be seen that the former, especially between Langenes and Cape Nassau,
are throughout much too small. No reason is given by De Veer for this discrepancy;
and, indeed, it would be difficult to account for it, were it not for the fact established
by the observations of Admiral Lütke, that a very powerful current from south to north
sets along the western coast of Novaya Zemlya as far as Cape Nassau. The velocity
of this current was ascertained by that intelligent seaman to be as much as sixty
miles per diem,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3107src" href="#xd33e3107" title="Go to note 163.">163</a> and owing to it he frequently found himself in a latitude from forty-five to fifty-five
miles further north than was shown by his dead reckoning.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3110src" href="#xd33e3110" title="Go to note 164.">164</a> A remarkable confirmation of this fact is afforded by Henry Hudson’s journal of his
visit to Novaya Zemlya, printed in <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxvi">[<a href="#pbcxxxvi">cxxxvi</a>]</span>the Appendix to the present work,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3115src" href="#xd33e3115" title="Go to note 165.">165</a> in which, under the date of 28th June 1608, it is stated that, between eight o’clock
on the previous evening and four o’clock in the morning, <i>they were drawn back to the northwards</i>, by a stream or tide, as far as they were the last evening at four o’clock. Applying
this, then, to the case of our Dutch navigators, we obtain a satisfactory explanation
of the apparent discrepancies in their several data.
</p>
<p>Having premised thus much, and remarking further that the southern portion of the
coast of Novaya Zemlya, and also the northern coast of Russia, require no discussion
here, we shall proceed to the investigation of the position of the principal points
between Langenes and Cape Nassau, with respect to which a difference of opinion exists.
The former point (as has already been stated) is that which was first approached by
Barents on his first voyage. On the 4th of July 1794, he found himself, by observation,
in latitude 73° 25′, being then about five or six miles west of Langenes,—a low projecting
point reaching far out into the sea.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3123src" href="#xd33e3123" title="Go to note 166.">166</a> This agrees best with the Dry Cape (Trockenes Cap) of the Russian map, which lies
in latitude 73° 45′; and Lütke accordingly identifies Langenes with it. Baer, however,
contends for Britwin Cape,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3126src" href="#xd33e3126" title="Go to note 167.">167</a> which, after Dry Cape, is the nearest projecting point of importance. But that cape
lies a whole degree further to the south, and would consequently differ as much as
40′ from Barents’s observed latitude; and such a difference is more than we are justified
in admitting, inasmuch as 15′ or 20′ must be taken as the <i>maximum</i> of error.
</p>
<p>The next point to be noted is Loms Bay, which is stated by De Veer to lie under 74⅓°;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3133src" href="#xd33e3133" title="Go to note 168.">168</a> the observation not being further particularized, as in most other cases. This would
make its difference of longitude from Langenes to be 55′; <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxvii">[<a href="#pbcxxxvii">cxxxvii</a>]</span>whereas, in De Veer’s map, the difference is only 20′. Lütke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3138src" href="#xd33e3138" title="Go to note 169.">169</a> identifies Loms Bay with Cross Bay, though without sufficiently stating his reasons
for so doing. Baer<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3141src" href="#xd33e3141" title="Go to note 170.">170</a> follows Lütke’s example, saying, however, still less on the subject. The latitude
of Cross Bay is 74° 10′ (Lütke says 74° 20′, but this must be an error, as his map
shows 10′, as does that also of Ziwolka), making a difference of 25′ from Dry Cape.
This would agree with De Veer’s map, and might, in this case, constitute a reason
for considering the latitude of Loms Bay, as stated by him in his text in so very
general a way, less trustworthy than that in his map. De Veer also gives<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3144src" href="#xd33e3144" title="Go to note 171.">171</a> a separate plan of Loms Bay, which neither Lütke nor Baer alludes to, evidently from
their not being acquainted with it. On a comparison of this special plan, as also
of De Veer’s general chart, with the Russian maps, it seems much more probable that
Loms Bay is not Cross Bay, but the bay immediately to the south of it. For Cross Bay
is, in fact, not a bay, but an extensive inlet, of which the end has not yet been
explored, and which is indeed regarded by the best Russian authorities as forming
a strait or passage completely across Novaya Zemlya, and communicating with Rosmuislov’s
Unknown Bay.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3148src" href="#xd33e3148" title="Go to note 172.">172</a> The Dutch, however, anchored in Loms Bay, went ashore, erected a beacon there, and
made a plan of the surrounding country; so that they must assuredly have ascertained
whether Loms Bay was a bay or strait. Moreover, they distinctly describe a “great
wide creek or inlet”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3153src" href="#xd33e3153" title="Go to note 173.">173</a> as lying to the north-east of Loms Bay, which is also shown in their plan, and which
cannot be any other than Cross Bay itself; and from this alone it would seem to follow
that the bay to the south of that inlet must be Loms Bay. Had Lütke made a careful
survey of the bay, which he was prevented from doing, and had he also been acquainted
with the Dutch plan, he would <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxviii">[<a href="#pbcxxxviii">cxxxviii</a>]</span>no doubt have been able to set this point at rest. Meanwhile we deem ourselves justified,
from what has been adduced, in regarding the Flache Bay of Lütke, or the Seichte Bay
of Ziwolka (both terms meaning “Shallow Bay”), as the Loms Bay of the Dutch; and hence
Cross Bay will be their “great wide creek or inlet,” while Lütke’s Cape Prokofyev
and Wrangel’s Island<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3158src" href="#xd33e3158" title="Go to note 174.">174</a> will be respectively their “Capo de Plantius” and their “small Island seawards from
the point.”
</p>
<p>The <span lang="nl">Admiraliteyts Eyland</span> of the Dutch<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3167src" href="#xd33e3167" title="Go to note 175.">175</a> is unquestionably the Admiralty Island or Peninsula of the Russians, there not being
any other point to the northward which answers to the description. Its latitude is
not given; but the Dutch and Russian maps agree satisfactorily.
</p>
<p>Capo Negro, or De Swart Hoeck (Black Point), is stated to be in latitude 75° 20′,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3172src" href="#xd33e3172" title="Go to note 176.">176</a> and answers to the first prominent cape in Lütke’s maps, after passing Admiralty
Island, which lies in 75° 28′.
</p>
<p>Willems Eyland<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3178src" href="#xd33e3178" title="Go to note 177.">177</a> is the Wilhelms Insel of Lütke, and the Bücklige Insel of Ziwolka. For this point
the elements of Barents’s observation for latitude are given, and they can consequently
be checked. It is most <span class="corr" id="xd33e3182" title="Source: satisfastory">satisfactory</span> to find that it differs only 9′ from the latitude given in the Russian maps, the
former being 75° 56′, and the latter 75° 47′. This also confirms the probable correctness
of the identifications of Admiralty Island and Black Point.
</p>
<p>De Hoeck van Nassau, placed by Barents in 76° 30′,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3187src" href="#xd33e3187" title="Go to note 178.">178</a> can be no other than Lütke’s Cape Nassau, in 76° 34′. Not only does the latitude
agree within 4′, but likewise its general bearing. There is also another point of
correspondence. It was not till the Hollanders reached Cape Nassau that their real
difficulties began, especially on the first voyage. This was the most northerly point
ever attained by Lütke, <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxix">[<a href="#pbcxxxix">cxxxix</a>]</span>and twice did he come within sight of this cape, but without being able to reach it.
Adverse winds and currents seem always to prevail here, even in the height of summer.
Baer differs, however,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3193src" href="#xd33e3193" title="Go to note 179.">179</a> from Lütke’s opinion, and regards his Cape Nassau as the north-easternmost point
of Novaya Zemlya, and identical with either the Ice Cape or Cape Desire of the Dutch,
while he places their Cape Nassau much further down towards the south-west, though
without being able to fix its precise position. But, for the reasons which have already
been adduced, we feel bound to dissent entirely from the learned Professor’s conclusions;
and we cannot but think that, had he been acquainted with De Veer’s original narrative,
he too would have seen that Lütke’s general identifications cannot well be disturbed.
</p>
<p>As regards the north-eastern portion of Novaya Zemlya beyond Cape Nassau, Lütke justly
argues<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3198src" href="#xd33e3198" title="Go to note 180.">180</a> that the general accuracy of Barents’s coast-line, as far as he has been able to
check it,—namely, as far as Cape Nassau,—warrants the assumption that those parts
which lie beyond that cape are in a similar degree correct; and, accordingly, he adopts
from the Dutch map the entire extent of country to the eastward of Cape Nassau, as
laid down in De Veer’s chart. This sound conclusion is, however, impugned by Baer,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3201src" href="#xd33e3201" title="Go to note 181.">181</a> who does not hesitate to erase the whole from his predecessor’s map, and to round
off the north-eastern extremity of Novaya Zemlya at a short distance beyond Cape Nassau.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after mature consideration of the entire subject, we are bound to declare
that not only do we concur in Lütke’s opinion generally, but we must add that no part
of the coast of Novaya Zemlya was so <span class="corr" id="xd33e3206" title="Source: thorougly">thoroughly</span> explored by Barents as just that portion which Baer has thus thought fit to dispute.
Barents traced that coast no less than four times, and his observation of the longitude
of his winter station, which has now for the first time been accurately <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxl">[<a href="#pbcxl">cxl</a>]</span>calculated by Mr. Edward Vogel (assistant at Mr. Bishop’s observatory),<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3211src" href="#xd33e3211" title="Go to note 182.">182</a> shows a difference of only about twenty-five miles in the distance between that spot
and Cape Nassau, as laid down in Gerrit de Veer’s chart:—a result which, as being
derived from totally independent data, is conclusive as to the general accuracy of
that chart.
</p>
<p>Consequently, without waiting for any corroboration to be obtained from future surveys,
we deem it perfectly safe to reinsert in our maps the north-eastern portion of Novaya
Zemlya, which has been omitted on the authority of Zivolka and Baer. This is a matter
not without importance, inasmuch as an extent of at least ten thousand square geographical
miles will thereby be restored to the Russian dominions. And we likewise consider
it due to the memory of the first and only explorer of this region, that it should
bear the specific designation of “Barents’s Land,” which name is accordingly given
to it in the accompanying map. To that portion of Novaya Zemlya which lies between
Barents’s Land and Matthew’s Land, we have further thought that no more fitting appellation
can be given than “Lütke’s Land,” in honour of that able navigator, who has done more
for the geography of Novaya Zemlya than any one since the time of Barents.
</p>
<p>For a considerable portion of the preceding remarks on the geography of Novaya Zemlya
we are indebted to Mr. Augustus Petermann, who has otherwise rendered us much assistance
during the progress of our labours, and by whose care the track of Barents on his
several voyages has been laid down in the accompanying charts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3217src" href="#xd33e3217" title="Go to note 183.">183</a> from the data furnished by Gerrit de Veer’s journals. The route from Kildin to Langenes
on the first voyage, was found by him to agree precisely with the true distance between
the former place <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxli">[<a href="#pbcxli">cxli</a>]</span>and Dry Cape; but the route from Bear Island to the coast of Novaya Zemlya, on the
third voyage, from its not being so minutely described, could only be laid down approximately.
Those along the more northerly portion of Novaya Zemlya are sufficiently correct,
and some of them are exceedingly precise, as has been shown in the preceding pages.
</p>
<p>On these voyages a number of soundings were taken in an otherwise unknown sea, the
value of which will be appreciated by nautical men. Those to the north of Novaya Zemlya
are most important. In about latitude 77° 45′, the highest point reached by Barents,
they give a depth of one hundred and fifty fathoms, without bottom;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3224src" href="#xd33e3224" title="Go to note 184.">184</a> showing the unlikelihood of the existence of any other land in that vicinity. We
feel persuaded that navigators of all nations will concur with us in the propriety
of distinguishing the <i lang="la">mare innominatum</i> between Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya by the appellation of “the Spitzbergen, or
Barents’s Sea,” as it is called in Mr. Petermann’s chart.
</p>
<p>Barents made so many discoveries and traced so large an extent of coast, both of Spitzbergen
and Novaya Zemlya, that the surveys of the whole of our recent explorers, put together,
are insufficient to identify all the points visited by him. One inference is obvious,
namely, that an able, fearless, and determined seaman like Barentz might yet achieve
much in those seas. Admiral Lütke was twice prevented by the ice from proceeding beyond
Cape Nassau; but he frequently alludes to the unfitness of his vessel to venture among
the ice, and gives it clearly as his opinion, at the end of his work,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3232src" href="#xd33e3232" title="Go to note 185.">185</a> that better success might be expected from vessels similar to those despatched from
England to the Arctic regions.
</p>
<p>The ten months’ residence of Barents and his companions at the furthest extremity
of Novaya Zemlya, has so often formed the subject of comment on the part of writers
on <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxlii">[<a href="#pbcxlii">cxlii</a>]</span>Arctic discovery, that we deem it unnecessary to dilate on it here, especially as
our other introductory remarks have already extended to so great a length.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that their stay at this particular spot was a forced one. At
the same time, when we bear in mind that, on the second voyage in the year preceding,
Barents and his colleague, Harman Janszoon, proposed that two of the vessels should
winter in the Sea of Kara; and that, on the fitting out of this third expedition,
they took up “as many vnmarryed men as they could, that they might not be disswaded,
by means of their wiues and children, to leaue off the uoyage;”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3242src" href="#xd33e3242" title="Go to note 186.">186</a> it will not be unreasonable to infer that they went fully resolved and prepared,
if obliged, to winter in those inhospitable regions.
</p>
<p>No words are sufficient to extol their exemplary conduct during their long and miserable
stay there. Though no means are afforded of determining the precise degree of cold
to which they were exposed, various incidents narrated by De Veer prove that it must
have been intense; and it was not merely a sharp clear cold, which the experience
of other Arctic explorers has shown may be borne to an almost inconceivable degree,
but it was accompanied by terrific storms of wind and snow, so that “a man could hardly
draw his breath,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3247src" href="#xd33e3247" title="Go to note 187.">187</a> and they “could hardly thrust their heads out of the dore.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3251src" href="#xd33e3251" title="Go to note 188.">188</a> One advantage was however derived from the snow which fell in such quantities as
completely to cover up their house, and thereby imparted to it a degree of comparative
warmth, without which it is most probable that their residence in it would not have
been endurable.
</p>
<p>Yet during the whole time perfect order, discipline, and subordination, joined to
the greatest unanimity and good feeling, prevailed among them. Scarcely a murmur passed
their lips; and when, in the beginning of May, after they had remained shut up more
than eight months, and the <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxliii">[<a href="#pbcxliii">cxliii</a>]</span>weather had the appearance of favouring their departure, some of the men “agreed amongst
themselues to speake unto the skipper (Heemskerck), and to tell him that it was more
than time to see about getting from thence”;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3259src" href="#xd33e3259" title="Go to note 189.">189</a> still each man was reluctant to be the spokesman, “because he had given them to understand
that he desired to staie vntil the end of June, which was the best of the sommer,
to see if the ship would then be loose”.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3262src" href="#xd33e3262" title="Go to note 190.">190</a> And even when at length they “agreed to speake to William Barents to moue the master
to goe from thence”, De Veer is careful to explain that “it was not done in a mutinous
manner, but to take the best counsell with reason and good advice, for they let themselves
easily be talked over.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3266src" href="#xd33e3266" title="Go to note 191.">191</a>
</p>
<p>Gerrit De Veer’s simple narrative has further an air of unaffected and unostentatious
piety and resignation to the will of Providence, which contrasts remarkably with the
general tone of Linschoten’s works, of which some instances have been given in the
preceding pages; and we may perceive that the reliance of himself and his comrades
on the Almighty was not less firm or sincere because His name was not incessantly
on their lips. Cheerfulness, and even frequent hilarity, could not fail to be the
concomitants of so wholesome a tone of mind; and these, joined to the bodily exercise
which they took at every possible opportunity, and the labour which they were compelled
to perform in preparing for their return voyage, must have been very instrumental
in preserving them from sickness.
</p>
<p>Still, with all the means employed to keep themselves in health,—and of these warm
bathing was no inconsiderable one,—it would be wrong to imagine that they were able
to preserve themselves from that dreaded scourge of Arctic navigators, the scurvy.
<span class="corr" id="xd33e3273" title="Source: Lutke">Lütke</span> observes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3276src" href="#xd33e3276" title="Go to note 192.">192</a> that “it is most remarkable that in the account of their long sufferings this <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxliv">[<a href="#pbcxliv">cxliv</a>]</span>disease <i>is not once mentioned</i>, and that of seventeen men <i>only two</i> died in Novaya Zemlya.” But it is from having known only the abbreviated translations
of Gerrit de Veer’s journal that the Russian admiral has been led to view the position
of those unfortunate men in this favourable light. For we see from De Veer’s narrative,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3286src" href="#xd33e3286" title="Go to note 193.">193</a> that as early as the 26th of January, 1597, when one of the crew died, he had even
then long lain seriously ill: and two days later it is expressly stated,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3289src" href="#xd33e3289" title="Go to note 194.">194</a> that, from their having “long time sitten without motion, several had thereby <i>fallen sick of the scurvy</i>.” Indeed, when we consider what they had to undergo for <i>six months</i>, during which period we find it positively recorded that they suffered from the scurvy,
until on the 28th of July they first met with a remedy,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3296src" href="#xd33e3296" title="Go to note 195.">195</a>—and how long previously the disease had shown itself among them cannot be said,—it
is almost miraculous that <i>only five</i> (not two) out of the seventeen should have fallen victims to it.
</p>
<p>The tradition of the memorable wintering of the Hollanders in the Ice Haven (Ledyanoi
Gávan) is still preserved among the Novaya Zemlya morse and seal hunters, who call
the spot where they so resided Sporai Navolok. It is not known however whether any
remains of the <i lang="nl">Behouden-huis</i>, or “house of safety”, have ever been found.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3306src" href="#xd33e3306" title="Go to note 196.">196</a>
</p>
<p>The most remarkable occurrence during their stay in Novaya Zemlya, was the unexpected
reappearance of the sun on the 24th of January, 1597. This phenomenon not only caused
the greatest surprise to the observers and their companions, but after their return
to Holland gave rise to much controversy among the learned men of the day. Their opinion
generally was unfavourable to the truth of the alleged fact, as being “opposed to
nature and to reason”. Among these was Robert Robertsz. le Canu, “<span lang="fr">homme fort entendu en l’art de la marine, et qui faisoit profession de l’enseigner
aux autres</span>”, who wrote a letter on the subject <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxlv">[<a href="#pbcxlv">cxlv</a>]</span>to William Blaeu, the father of the celebrated John Blaeu, which was published by
the latter in his Great Atlas. This letter shall be reproduced here, not merely on
account of its giving the objections which were raised at the time, but because it
likewise contains some curious matters relating personally to our author and his companions,
which it would be wrong to omit.

<p class="first salute">Mon bon amy Guillaume Jansse Blaeu,
</p>
<p>Puisque vous m’avez témoigné desirer que je vous envoyasse un extrait du discours
que j’ay eu avec Jacob Heemskerck, Gerard de Veer, Jean Corneille Rijp, et plusieurs
autres de mes escoliers, lesquels ayant fait voile en l’an 1596, retournerent en 1597,
sans avoir rien effectué touchant la commission qu’ils avoyent de reconnoistre les
Royaumes de la Chine, &amp; du Cathay, &amp; dans la mesme année 1597 me vinrent trouver pour
me raconter les merveilleuses aventures de leur voyage, entre lesquelles la plus remarquable
estoit, que le Soleil leur estoit disparu le <span class="sc">IV</span> de Novembre en l’an 1596, &amp; avoyent commencé de le revoir l’an 1597 le 24 de Ianvier,
sous la mesme hauteur de 76 degrez, sous laquelle ils avoient basty leur maison dans
la Nouvelle Zemble, matiere suffisante, ainsi qu’ils ont escrit, pour exercer long-temps
les beaux esprits: &amp; puis qu’outre vostre propre satisfaction vous me conviez encor
à vous declarer mon sentiment sur ce sujet par l’advis que vous me donnez des contentions
&amp; debats survenus à cette occasion entre tous les sçavans de l’Europe, je veux vous
faire un court recit du Dialogue que j’ay eu là dessus avec tous ces Messieurs que
j’ay deja nommez, qui avoyent esté spectateurs d’une chose si extraordinaire, &amp; qui
me la raconterent avec grand estonnement; je raisonnois donc avec eux comme il s’ensuit:
</p>
<p>Considerant en moy mesme qu’ils avoient passé plus de dix semaines dans un jour perpetuel
sans avoir eu aucune nuict, &amp; que pendant un si long espace de temps le ciel n’avoit
pas tousjours esté si clair qu’on pût, à la faveur de sa lumière, marquer &amp; compter
exactement chaque tour que le Soleil faisoit à l’entour de la terre, je leur demandois
s’ils estoient bien asseurez, qu’il fust le <span class="sc">IV</span> de Novembre lors qu’ils perdirent de veuë le Soleil, d’autant qu’il estoit en ce
temps-là plus de 15 degrez vers le Sud par delà la ligne; ils me respondirent qu’ils
avoyent tousjours eu devant eux leurs <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxlvi">[<a href="#pbcxlvi">cxlvi</a>]</span>horologes, &amp; leurs sables, en sorte qu’ils n’avoyent pas le moindre sujet de douter
de cette verité. Je m’enquestay de plus, si leurs horologes, ou leurs monstres, n’avoient
jamais manqué, ou s’ils n’avoyent jamais trouvé leurs sables vuides; &amp; voulus outre
cela sçavoir d’eux, de combien la Lune estoit âgée lors que le Soleil leur avoit failly:
ils demeurerent court à cette interrogation; ce qui me donna lieu de croire qu’ils
n’avoyent pas bien compté les jours, &amp; que la supputation qui leur marquoit pour le
IV de Novembre, le jour que le Soleil commença à s’absenter d’eux, estoit fausse.
Mais supposé, dis-je, que vous ayez si bien rencontré dans vostre calcul qu’il fust
alors le IV de Novembre, que mesme vous ayez avec tres-grande justesse compassé tous
les jours d’Esté, d’où pouvez vous tirer certaine asseurance de ne vous estre pas
mesconté d’un seul jour pendant l’Hyver, que la nuit duroit des onze semaines entieres,
puisque vous demeuriez la pluspart du temps comme ensevelis dans vostre maisonnette,
&amp; que pour la crainte des extremes froidures, des tourbillons de neiges &amp; des autres
rigueures, auxquelles ce climat est exposé durant une si rude saison, vous n’osiez
tant seulement mettre le nez dehors, &amp; ne pouviez par consequent voir ny Soleil, ny
Lune, ny Estoilles. Gerard de Veer me respondit, qu’ils avoyent perpetuellement veu
l’estoille Polaire par le trou de leur cheminée, par où ils avoyent encor remarqué
tres-distinctement tous les tours que la grande Ourse faisoit à l’entour de ce Pole;
joint qu’ils avoyent tousjours eu devant eux <span class="corr" id="xd33e3331" title="Source: de">des</span> monstres, des horologes, &amp; des sables, auxquels ils prenoyent tres-soigneusement
garde tous les jours. Je ne voulus pas entrer en dispute avec luy là dessus, mais
je ne pûs prendre ses raisons pour argent comptant, &amp; je n’en demeuray nullement persuadé,
veu mesme qu’en Esté ils estoyent assez empeschez à se defendre de l’attaque des Ours,
ainsi qu’ils disoient; &amp; en Hyver souvent occupez à la chasse des renards: de sorte
que, selon mon advis, ils n’avoient pas tousjours le loisir de vaquer comme il faut
aux observations celestes, ny de gouverner leurs monstres, horologes, &amp; sables avec
l’assiduité necessaire, lesquelles, peut-estre, ils ont fort souvent trouvé vuides,
ou detraquées par la gelée. Vous croyez donc, Maistre Robert, comme vous nous donnez
à entendre par vos raisons, repartit Iacob Heemskerck, que nous nous sommes grandement
abusez dans nostre calcul? Je n’ay pas cette croyance là seulement, respondis je,
mais de plus une ferme persuasion, que la faute en est si grande, qu’il vous est impossible
de sçavoir au vray <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxlvii">[<a href="#pbcxlvii">cxlvii</a>]</span>si vous estiez pour lors à la fin de Ianvier, ou au commencement de Febvrier: car
bienque je leur fisse plusieurs interrogations pour apprendre en quelles parties du
ciel ils avoyent veu la Lune, les Planetes &amp; les Estoilles, &amp; par quel moyen ils avoyent
pris leurs hauteurs le 24 de Janvier, auquel jour ils disoyent que le Soleil s’estoit
monstré à eux, comme aussi pour sçavoir si c’estoit à six heures du soir, ou à minuit,
ou le lendemain à six heures du matin, et dans quel rombe cette apparition s’estoit
faite, ils ne sceurent neantmoins respondre à aucunes de mes demandes, d’autant qu’en
ce temps-là ils avoyent manqué de faire telles observations: c’est pourquoy je conclus,
qu’ils s’estoyent bien mespris dans leur compte de la valeur de dix ou onze jours,
ou plus. Le lendemain ils accoururent tous chez moy, pour me dire qu’ils sçavoyent
bien en quel endroit estoit la Lune le 24 de Janvier, mais je leur respondis que la
lecture de quelques doctes Ephemerides les avoit rendu bien sçavans depuis quelques
heures, &amp; leur avoit enseigné ce qu’ils ignoroient hier lors que je leur en fis la
demande. Gerard de Veer, qui a esté escrivain de la navigation vers le Nord, me tint
plusieurs discours aussi mal fondez que les precedents, lesquels je m’estois au commencement
proposé de rediger par escrit; mais par apres je ne l’ay pas jugé necessaire, &amp; m’en
suis abstenu, par ce qu’il est demeuré ferme dans son opinion, &amp; qu’il a du depuis
fait imprimer son Journal, dans lequel il a deduit tout au long cette histoire dans
la page 34, &amp; 35, mais escritte en autres caracteres que le reste, afin qu’elle fust
plus remarquable,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3336src" href="#xd33e3336" title="Go to note 197.">197</a> comme on peut voir dans ce mesme livre imprimé à Amsterdam, en l’année 1598, où il
escrit, que tres-voluntiers il rendra compte de son dire: mais je n’ignore pas quel
est le compte, que Gerard de Veer a rendu &amp; envoyé à Martin Everard de Bruges, demeurant
pour lors à Leyde, qui le luy avoit auparavant demandé par lettre escritte à ce sujet;
car luy mesme m’a monstré cette lettre, et demandé advis de ce qu’il devoit faire
pour le mieux: je luy dis, que tout le conseil que j’avois à luy donner, estoit qu’il
<span class="corr" id="xd33e3340" title="Source: reconnut">reconnust</span> sa faute, &amp; confessast ingenuement, que luy, &amp; toute sa compagnie s’estoyent pû mesprendre
de quelques petites journées pendant le grand jour <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxlviii">[<a href="#pbcxlviii">cxlviii</a>]</span>d’Esté qu’ils avoyent eu; &amp; que pendant la longue nuit d’Hyver, ils en avoyent peu
laisser escouler quelques petites, sans y prendre garde, pendant lesquelles les insupportables
rigueurs du froid les <span class="corr" id="xd33e3345" title="Source: auroit">auroient</span> accablez de sommeil: mais toutes mes remonstrances ont esté vaines; car il n’avoit
pas mis en lumière son Journal pour le corriger par apres; et jusques à la fin de
sa vie il est demeuré dans l’erreur que ses observations estoyent tres-asseurées:
&amp; ce Gerard de Veer a bien sceu dans son Journal renfermer 56 jours entre le 24 de

sur leur Horizon de 14 degrez seulement, au lieu que dans le mesme temps de ces 56
jours il devoit avoir monté sur le mesme Horizon à la hauteur de 19 degrez. Je tire
cette conclusion de ce que Gerard de Veer a bien sceu faire entrer 13 ou 14 jours

il n’a pas craint d’inserer en son Journal, afin de maintenir &amp; d’affermir son opinion,

ma premiere conclusion, à sçavoir, que durant la grande nuit d’Hyver d’onze semaines,
le sommeil les avoit pû gaigner si souvent, &amp; si long-temps, qu’il estoit le 6 ou
7 de Febvrier, lors qu’ils ont creu, à cause de leur assoupissement, qu’il n’estoit

que Gerard de Veer ressemble au Sacristain qui fait aller l’horologe, laquelle n’ayant

la raison de cette erreur, il respondit que le Soleil pouvoit mentir, mais que son

sur la Lune, &amp; sur les Estoilles, que de confesser pendant sa vie que son calcul estoit
faux. Voilà en peu de mots ce que j’ay à respondre sur vostre demande, car je n’ay

</p>
<p>From this letter of Robert le Canu it will be perceived, that the fact of the sun’s
disappearance on the 4th of November 1596 was equally denied by him with that of its
reappearance on the 24th of January following. The former, though differing in degree,
was, as far as regards the fact itself, deemed not less abnormal and “opposed to nature
and to reason” than the latter. It is therefore of importance to demonstrate that
the particulars recorded by Gerrit de Veer concerning the sun’s latest appearance
and final disappearance, are in all respects absolutely and literally true.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbcl">[<a href="#pbcl">cl</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the 2nd of November, he states that the sun “did not show its whole disk, but passed
in the horizon along the earth.” On that day, in latitude 75° 45′ (which was their
true position, and not 76° as they supposed), the sun’s declination was—14° 53′<sub><span class="corr" id="xd33e3401" title="Not in source">,</span>3</sub>; and the complement of the <span class="corr" id="xd33e3404" title="Source: eleva-vation">elevation</span> of the Pole being 14° 15′, the sun’s centre was actually 38′<sub>3</sub> below the horizon. But, with an assumed temperature of—8 Fahr., the refraction would
have been as much as 39′<sub>,3</sub>; and, as “the land where they were was as high as the round-top of their ship”, an
assumed height of thirty feet would give 5′<sub>,4</sub> for the dip of the horizon. Hence, according to theory, 6′<sub>,4</sub> more than the half of the sun’s disk should have been visible; that is to say, 22′
or 23′, or about seven-tenths of the entire disk. Consequently De Veer’s statement
in this respect is literally true. On the following day the sun’s centre was actually
56′<sub>,9</sub>, and its upper edge about 40′<sub>,9</sub>, below the horizon. But the refraction 39′<sub>,3</sub> and the dip 5′<sub>,4</sub>, would have raised it 44′<sub>,7</sub> to the sight; so that 3′<sub>,8</sub> or nearly twelve-hundredths of the sun’s disk ought still to have been visible. De
Veer speaks therefore the pure truth when he says that, on the 3rd of November, “they
could see nothing but the upper edge of the sun above the horizon.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3439src" href="#xd33e3439" title="Go to note 200.">200</a> On the day afterwards the sun’s declination was 15° 30′<sub>,5</sub>, and consequently its centre was 1° 15′<sub>,5</sub>, and its upper edge 59′<sub>,5</sub>, below the horizon. And taking the sum of the refraction and the dip at 44′<sub>,7</sub>, the sun’s <span class="pageNum" id="pbcli">[<a href="#pbcli">cli</a>]</span>upper edge would have been actually 14′,<sub>8</sub> below the visible horizon. Strictly in accordance with this, we have De Veer’s statement
on the 4th of November, “but that we saw the sunne no more, for it was no longer aboue
the horizon”.
</p>
<p>Had Gerrit de Veer and his companions been weak enough to give way to the dogmatical
assertion of their teacher, that “<span lang="fr">pendant le grand jour d’esté ils avoyent omis à compter quelques revolutions du soleil</span>”, they might perhaps at the time, and during the two centuries and a half which have
since elapsed, have enjoyed some little more credit than has been accorded to them;
but they would eventually have deprived themselves of that triumphant vindication
of their character for perfect truthfulness and sincerity which it is our good fortune
to be the means of now affording to them.
</p>
<p>The reappearance of the sun on the 25th of January 1597, is not, at least for the
present, capable of so complete and satisfactory an explanation. But hitherto the
subject has never been properly understood, because the facts have never been correctly
stated. One of the most recent examinations of this phenomenon is that made by the
Rev. George Fisher, in his remarks “On the Atmospheric Refraction,” contained in the
“Appendix to Captain Parry’s Journal of a Second Voyage, etc.<span class="corr" id="xd33e3472" title="Not in source">”</span>, published in 1825.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher’s words are:—“The testimony of De Veer, who wrote the particulars and who
accompanied Barentz to Nova Zembla in his third voyage, where he wintered in latitude
76° N., in the year 1596–7, has been so often called in question, with respect to
his account of the re-appearance of the sun, that it is but justice to state that
he appears to be perfectly correct, and his observations consistent with those made
during this voyage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3477src" href="#xd33e3477" title="Go to note 201.">201</a> He reports that he, in <span class="pageNum" id="pbclii">[<a href="#pbclii">clii</a>]</span>company with two others, saw the edge of the sun from the sea side, on the south side
of Nova Zembla, on the 24th of January (or the 3rd of February, new style) at which
time the sun’s declination when it passed the meridian in that longitude was about
16° 48′ S., and therefore the true meridian depression of the upper limb at noon was
2° 32′ nearly, which ought to have been the amount of the refraction [so] that the
limb might have been visible. Now, if the observation at the least apparent altitude
observed on the 23rd January, 1823, at Igloolik, which was 8′ 40″, be reduced to the
horizon, by observing the rapid law of increase in the refraction visible in the series
of observations made on that day, the horizontal refraction cannot be estimated at
less than 2° 30′, and which, if increased by the apparent dip (which sometimes amounts
to more than 20′ in the winter time, as I have mentioned when speaking of the terrestrial
refraction), will be quite sufficient to render the upper limb visible; and there
is still less difficulty in believing that they ‘saw the sunne in his full roundnesse
above the horizon’ three days afterwards, since the daily motion in declination at
that time of the year is nearly 18 minutes to the northward.
</p>
<p>“M. Le Monier, from the observations made on these two days, assures us that there
must have been more than 4½ degrees of refraction, and that he ‘could neither explain
these observations, reject them as doubtful, nor suppose any error, as was done by
most other astronometers.’ How this conclusion has been deduced from the facts related
in the Journal does not appear, neither is there the least occasion to reject as doubtful
the simple and honest account of the Dutchmen.”
</p>
<p>Now the facts of the case are in reality as follows:—In the first place, the Dutch
reckoned their time according to the <i>new</i> style, which had already been adopted in the Netherlands. This is not only to be
deduced from <span class="pageNum" id="pbcliii">[<a href="#pbcliii">cliii</a>]</span>the correspondence of their several astronomical observations with this reckoning
alone; but it also admits of direct proof from the express statement of William Barents,
in his note on the tides at States Island, that the dates were “<i lang="it">stilo novo</i>.”
</p>
<p>In the next place, Gerrit de Veer states explicitly that he and two of his companions
“saw the edge of the sun” on the 24th of January, and that on the 27th of that month
they “all went forth and saw the sunne in his full roundnesse a little aboue the horrison”;
and again, that on the 31st they “went out and saw the sunne shine cleare”; and lastly,
on the 8th of February, they “saw the sun rise south south-east, and went down south
south-west.” On the intervening days, the weather being cloudy or otherwise unfavourable,
they had no opportunity of observing the sun.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3494src" href="#xd33e3494" title="Go to note 202.">202</a>
</p>
<p>Now, according to theory, the sun’s upper edge ought not, in 75° 45′ north latitude,
to have been visible till the 9th of February; so that on the 25th of January (not
the 24th, as De Veer erroneously supposed), at mid-day, the extraordinary and anomalous
refraction was as much as 3° 49′, and on the 27th of that month it could not have
been much, if at all, less. On the 8th of February, however, when they “saw the sun
rise S.S.E. and go down S.S.W.”, the entire refraction would have been 2° 10′,<sub>7</sub>, which is about one degree and a half more than according to theory it ought to have
been; and on the 19th of the latter month, <span class="pageNum" id="pbcliv">[<a href="#pbcliv">cliv</a>]</span>when they took the sun’s height, the refraction had again attained its normal amount.
</p>
<p>Without attempting any explanation of the phenomenon thus described, what we have
now to do is to show that Gerrit de Veer and his companions could not possibly have
been materially in error with respect to their dates.
</p>
<p>Commencing then from the 4th of November, when it has been demonstrated that their
time was strictly correct, we have their subsequent astronomical observations on December
14th and January 12th, which establish that till the latter date they were still right
in their time. If, therefore, they lost their reckoning at all, it must have happened
between the 12th and the 25th of January—an interval of <i>only thirteen days</i>; and certainly neither their oversleeping themselves (assuming them to have done
so), nor any error, however great, in the rate of their twelve hours’ sand-glass,
could in that short interval have occasioned any gross miscalculation with respect
to the time of a phenomenon which extended over a period of fourteen days. Then again,
on the 19th of February, and also on the 2nd of March, they obtained by similar astronomical
observations the means of checking their time; so that it is utterly impossible for
them to have fallen into any material error. The mistake of <i>a few hours</i>, which caused them to place the conjunction of the moon and Jupiter, and consequently
the reappearance of the sun, on the 24th instead of the 25th of January, is only an
additional proof in favour of their general correctness, as it is just such an error
as they were likely to fall into from their inability to measure their time with strict
precision.
</p>
<p>But the fact of the conjunction itself has yet to be noticed. De Veer tells us that
they had watched the approach of the two planets to each other, till at length they
came together in a certain direction and at a certain time; and that contemporaneously
<span class="pageNum" id="pbclv">[<a href="#pbclv">clv</a>]</span>with this occurrence the sun reappeared. Now there was no other conjunction of those
two planets till 27¼ days later, namely, at noon on the 21st of February, and at that
date the sun had been at least nine days above the horizon; besides which, the conjunction
would not have been visible, on account of the daylight. Consequently, if the conjunction
on the 25th of January is not intended, the whole account must be an invention and
a fabrication. And to suppose this would assuredly be imputing to De Veer, not only
more deceit, but also very much more skill than he possessed. For, even assuming him
to have been capable of calculating the place of Jupiter and the time of that planet’s
setting, he would have found (as Mr. Vogel has now found) that at the time of the
conjunction that planet had already set 1 hour and 48 minutes, and was at the time
actually 2° 44′ below the horizon; and it is altogether too much to suppose that he
would have adduced a conjunction, <i>which according to calculation was invisible</i>, as evidence of another phenomenon which was equally opposed to the recognized laws
of nature.
</p>
<p>We have therefore no alternative but to receive the facts recorded by De Veer as substantially
true, and to believe that owing to the peculiar condition of the atmosphere, there
existed an extraordinary refraction, not merely on the 25th of January, but continuously
during fourteen days afterwards, at first amounting to nearly four degrees, but gradually
decreasing to about one degree and a half.
</p>
<p>The true facts of the case having at length been clearly made out, they are left for
elucidation by those who are best qualified to investigate and explain them. The problem
is a curious, and, with our still insufficient knowledge of the laws of atmospheric
refraction in high latitudes, a difficult one. Nevertheless we may confidently rely
on the result <span class="pageNum" id="pbclvi">[<a href="#pbclvi">clvi</a>]</span>being such as eventually to establish the entire veracity of our Dutch historian.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3522src" href="#xd33e3522" title="Go to note 203.">203</a>
</p>
<p>With respect to the personal history of Gerrit de Veer we know almost nothing. From
his familiar allusion to “the salt hills that are in Spaine”, it is to be inferred
that he had visited that country at some time previously to the year 1595, when he
joined Barents’s second expedition. From Robert le Canu’s letter we learn that he
had studied navigation under him, and also that his death occurred some time previously
to the year 1627, when that letter was written. The position of his name in the two
lists of the crew of Heemskerck’s vessel, between those of the first mate and the
surgeon, shows that he was one of the officers—probably the second mate; and we learn
incidentally that he was a small man, “being the lightest of all their company”. More
than this we know not.

<p>Of the various editions, abridgments, and summaries of De Veer’s work, we have collected
the following particulars.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first hangIndent"><span class="sc">To</span> <i>the Noble, Mighty, Wise, Discreet, and very Provident Lords, the States General of
the United Netherlands, the Council of State, and the Provincial States of Holland,
Zeeland and West Friesland; and also to the most illustrious Prince and Lord, Maurice,
born Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau, Catzenellenbogen, Vianden, Dietz, etc., Marquis
of Vere and Flushing, etc., Lord of St. Vyt, Doesburg, the city of Grave, and the

Zeeland, West Friesland, Utrecht, and Over­yssel, and Admiral of the sea; and to the
Noble, Honorable, Wise, and Discreet Lords, the Commissioners of the Admiralty in
Holland, Zeeland, and West Friesland</i>.
</p>
<p>My Lords: the art of navigation, which in utility surpasses nearly all other arts,
has now in these latter years and within the memory of man been wonderfully improved,
and has more especially contributed to the welfare of these States. This has been
mainly the result of the skilful use and practice of navigation, and of the measurement
of the latitudes and bearings of countries according to the rules of mathematical
science; whereby countries lying on the very confines of the world have been reached,
and their products imported for our use. Thus this child of Astrology has <span class="pageNum" id="pbclviii">[<a href="#pbclviii">clviii</a>]</span>proved of greater service on the ocean than on land; for, there it is merely a science,
whereas here its usefulness is so much extended, that various bearings, courses, headlands,
and <span class="corr" id="xd33e3561" title="Source: promontaries">promontories</span> unmentioned by Ptolemy and Strabo, and unknown for a long period after that time,
have now become known by the investigations and experiences of this science. And as
many previously unknown places were not found till after repeated search, so now three
unsuccessful trials have been made from these States to find a passage round by the
north to the kingdoms of Cathay and China; which although hitherto unsuccessful, have
not been altogether useless, nor have they shown the attempt to be hopeless. For these
reasons I have drawn up a brief description of the three aforesaid voyages (in the
last two of which I myself was engaged), which were made from these States by the
north of Norway, Muscovy, and Tartary, towards the aforesaid kingdoms of Cathay and
China. And I have done so because many interesting circumstances happened in those
voyages, and because I think that the right course may still be discovered; inasmuch
as the direction and position of Vaygatz and Nova Zembla, and also the eastern part
of Greenland (as we call it) in 80°, are now ascertained, where it was formerly thought
there was only water and no land; and because there in 80° it was less cold than at
Nova Zembla in 76°, and in 80° aforesaid, in June early in the summer, plants and
grass were growing and beasts that feed on grass were found, while on the contrary
in 76°, in August in the hottest of the summer, there were found neither plants nor
grass, nor animals that feed on grass. From all which it appears that it is not the
proximity of the Pole which causes the ice and cold, but the Sea of Tartary (called
the Frozen Ocean), and the proximity of the land, round about which the ice remains
floating. For, in the open sea between the land situated in 80 degrees and Nova Zembla,
which lie at a distance of full 200 (800) miles E.N.E. and W.S.W. of each other, there
was little or no ice; but as often as we approached land we immediately fell in with
the cold and the ice. Indeed, it was by means of the ice that we always first perceived
that we were near land before we saw the land itself. At the east end of Nova Zembla
also, where we passed the winter, the ice drifted away with a W. and S.W. wind, and
returned with a N.E. wind. Hence it certainly appears, that between the two lands
there is an open sea, and that it is possible to sail nearer to the Pole than has
hitherto been believed; and this notwithstanding <span class="pageNum" id="pbclix">[<a href="#pbclix">clix</a>]</span>that ancient writers say that the sea is not navigable within 20 degrees of the Pole
because of the intense cold, and that therefore nobody can live there; whereas we
have both been as far as 80 degrees, and in 76 degrees have with small means passed
the winter; and thus it appears that the said passage may be effected between the
two above-named countries by taking a N.E. course from the North Cape in Norway. This
too was the opinion of the renowned pilot Willem Barentsz., as well as of Jacob Heemskerck,
our captain and supercargo, who would have dared to undertake it by keeping that course,
its accomplishment being left to God’s mercy. Yea, notwithstanding that on our last
voyage, through our manifold difficulties, we were entirely exhausted and ofttimes
in peril of death, yet our courage was not so broken but that if our ship (which became
fast in the ice) had been set free a little sooner, we would once more have made the
attempt in that direction, as a proof that we believed the passage might thereby have
been effected; although this last voyage had been very troublesome, wherein we (speaking
without vanity) made no account either of labours, difficulties, or danger, in order
to bring it to a successful end, as will appear from the relation thereof; but neither
the time nor the opportunity permitted it. And as the aforesaid three voyages were
made through the gracious assistance of your Lordships, and thus the fruits which
may still result from them belong to your Lordships, I have taken the liberty of dedicating
to you this narrative, which, if not an eloquent, is at least a faithful one.
</p>
<p>Praying to God that he will bless with success the government of your Lordships, in
honour of his name, and for the welfare of these States,

<p>This edition contains forty-four numbered leaves, and the same plates and maps as
the original Dutch edition. There is a copy in the Grenville Library. It was reprinted
in 1600 and in 1609. There is a copy of the edition of 1609 in the <span class="pageNum" id="pbclxii">[<a href="#pbclxii">clxii</a>]</span>British Museum, in which the same plates and maps occur as in the first Dutch edition.

<p>An edition in 8vo. was published at Paris by Chaudière in 1599, under the title of
“<span lang="fr">Trois navigations admirables faites par les Hollandois et les Zélandois au Septentrion.</span>”
</p>
<p><i>Italian.</i> An Italian translation, which was made at the instance of Gioan Battista Ciotti,
by whom it is dedicated to Gasparo Catanei, appeared at Venice in 1599, in Italic
characters. Its title runs thus:—

translated, is English; the first and only edition of which translation, now extremely
scarce, is that reproduced in the present volume.
</p>
<p>ABRIDGEMENTS.
</p>
<p><i>German.</i> The first and most important German edition of De Veer’s narrative was an abridgement,
published at Nuremberg by Levinus Hulsius, the dedication of which <span class="pageNum" id="pbclxiii">[<a href="#pbclxiii">clxiii</a>]</span>bears date the 10th of August, 1598, being little more than three months after that
of the original Dutch work. Its title runs thus:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="de">

</p>
<p>Translator’s dedication two pages. Preface twelve pages. An address to the reader,
headed and subscribed “Gerardus de Veer,” four pages. Text one hundred and forty-six
numbered pages. Thirty-five plates and maps. The colophon reads:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="de">

</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It was re-issued in the year 1602, as the “<span lang="de">Dritter Theil</span>” of Hulsius’s celebrated collection of voyages. This is, however, merely a duplicate
of the edition of 1598, excepting the first sheet, which has been reprinted, apparently
with the view of affording Hulsius an opportunity of alluding, on the fourth page
of his Preface, to the publication of the beautiful book (“<span lang="de">schones Buch</span>”) of Linschoten the year before. The dedication is dated Nuremberg, 6th February.
</p>
<p>A “<span lang="la">secunda editio</span>,” considerably abridged, appeared from the same press in the same year (1602), with
the dedication dated Frankfort, 1st August: the text of this extends only to one hundred
and twenty-one pages, and the address to <span class="pageNum" id="pbclxiv">[<a href="#pbclxiv">clxiv</a>]</span>the reader and colophon are omitted. In his dedication, Hulsius informs us, as a reason
for this rapidity of republication, that upwards of 1,500 copies of the former edition
had already been disposed of, and that the demand for the work was still very great.
</p>
<p>A third and fourth edition, yet further abridged, and similarly forming the “Dritter
Theil” of Hulsius’s collection, appeared respectively in the years 1612 and 1660.
</p>
<p>Copies of all these editions are in the Grenville Library in the British Museum.
</p>
<p>This work of Hulsius enjoys a degree of credit among bibliographers, to which intrinsically
it would hardly seem to be entitled. On the title-page, and also in the publisher’s
dedication, it professes to be a <i>translation</i> from the Dutch of Gerrit de Veer. But it is neither this, nor is it a true and genuine
<i>abridgement</i>. On the contrary, copious omissions are made throughout, while at the same time passages
are frequently introduced, which are not to be found in the original. It would be
an almost endless task, and one quite out of place here, to attempt a collation of
the two works. Still it is expedient that a specimen should be adduced of the liberties
which Hulsius has taken with his author; and for this purpose the commencement of
his narrative of the second expedition (pages 16–18) shall be given <i>verbatim</i>.

</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A comparison of the foregoing with Phillip’s translation in pages 42–44 of the present
volume, will at once show how widely Hulsius’s version differs from the original text
of Gerrit de Veer.
</p>
<p>From the use made of De Veer’s name in the “Address to the Reader,” it might at first
sight be imagined that Hulsius was in communication with the author, and had his authority
for the interpolated passages; though, seeing that Latin and French versions, corresponding
strictly with the original Dutch text, were being simultaneously published at Amsterdam,
it would certainly be difficult to conceive that De Veer should have lent himself
to a work so different in character as this German version. However, on a closer examination,
it is apparent that this “Address,” notwithstanding that it is made to bear De Veer’s
signature, with the date “<span lang="la">Penult. Aprilis Anno 1598</span>,”—which is that of the author’s original Dedication to the States General and other
authorities of the United Provinces, of which a translation has been given in pages
cxix–cxxii,—is merely made up from that dedication and from the introductory portion
of the author’s narrative of the first voyage. And, indeed, Hulsius himself does not
pretend to do more than give a translation into German from the original Dutch work;
his words being, “<span lang="de">Hab ich auch dise drey letzte Schiffarten gegen Mitnacht, <i>so bald sie mir in Niderlandischer sprach zukommĕ</i>, ins hochteutsch versetzt</span>;” so that his use of the author’s name in the way adverted to is manifestly unjustifiable,
and in fact nothing better than a fraud on the public.
</p>
<p>The foregoing specimen of the differences between the <span class="pageNum" id="pbclxvii">[<a href="#pbclxvii">clxvii</a>]</span>two works has purposely been taken from the commencement of the narrative of the <i>second</i> expedition, because we have the independent authority of Linschoten to fall back
upon; in whose work nothing is found to warrant the interpolations on the 5th and
12th of July, and whose official description of the vessels composing that expedition—which
forms the basis of the statement made in previous pages of the present Introduction,—differs
materially from that given by Hulsius.
</p>
<p>It is scarcely to be doubted that the latter had an authority of some sort for these
important variations; though had that authority been at all of an authentic nature,
there is no conceivable reason why he should not have referred to it. On a consideration
of the whole case, we are inclined to believe that he was desirous of imparting to
his production the character of an original work; and hence these variations in the
text, and also the fact that most of his illustrations are not copies, but free imitations
of the plates in the original Amsterdam editions.
</p>
<p>Before quitting this subject, which is perhaps not undeserving of a closer investigation,
we may adduce a curious instance of erroneous translation on the part of Hulsius.
In the introduction to the narrative of the second voyage (page 40 of the present
work), De Veer speaks of Linschoten as having been on the first voyage the commissary
or supercargo of the two ships of Zeeland and Enkhuysen—“daer Jan Huyghen van Linschoten
<i>comis</i> op was.” This is rendered by Hulsius (p. 14): “<span lang="de">darauff der Hocherfahrne in Schiffsachē Johan̄ Huyghen von Linschott, <i>Comes</i> oder Oberster gewesen war</span>,” as if Linschoten had actually been the commander of those two vessels!
</p>
<p>Another German abridgement of De Veer’s narrative was made by the brothers De Bry,
in 1599, and is given as the third article in the third part of their <i lang="la">India Orientalis</i> (or that portion of their collection commonly known as the <span class="pageNum" id="pbclxviii">[<a href="#pbclxviii">clxviii</a>]</span><i lang="fr">Petits Voyages</i>), on the collective title of which it is described as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="de">
<p class="first">Drey Schiffahrten der Holländer nach obermeldten Indien durch das Mittnächtigsche
oder Eissmeer darinnen viel vnerhörte Ebentewer. Sampt Vielen schönen künstlichen
figurn vnd Landtafeln in Kupffer gestochen vnd an Tag geben durch Jo. Theodor vnd
Jo. Israel de Bry, Gebrüder. Gedruckt zu Franckfurt am Mayn durch Mattheum Becker.
<span class="sc">M.D.XCIX.</span> folio.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It is from this German edition that the plates which accompany the present volume
have been taken. They are copies from those of the original Amsterdam editions, reversed
and more artistically finished. De Bry, doubtless having Hulsius’s work in his mind,
says of them that they are: “<span lang="de">Alles zierlich und <i>nach dem aechten original</i> fürgetragen.</span>”
</p>
<p>This abridgement was reprinted in the German editions of De Bry in 1628 and 1629.
</p>
<p><i>Latin.</i> The same abridgement was also given in Latin by De Bry, in the edition of the <i>India Orientalis</i> of 1601, on the collective title of the third part of which it is thus described:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">Tres nauigationes Hollandorum in modò dictam Indiam per Septentrionalem seu glacialem
Oceanum, vbi mira quædam et stupenda denarrantur.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The sub-title, at page 129, is as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">Tertia pars, Navigationes tres discretas, trib. continvis annis per Septentrionem
supra Norvegiam, Mvscoviam et Tartariam, freto Weygatz &amp; Noua Zembla detectis, ab
Hollandis &amp; Zelandis in Cathay &amp; Chinarum regnum versus orientem susceptas, describens.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This abridgement was reprinted in 1629, also as the third article in the third part
of De Bry’s <i>India Orientalis</i>.
</p>
<p><i>English.</i> In the third volume of Purchas’s collection, pp. 473–518, is given a faithful abridgement
of Phillip’s translation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pbclxix">[<a href="#pbclxix">clxix</a>]</span>
</p>
<p>ABSTRACTS OR SUMMARIES.
</p>
<p><i>Latin.</i> An abstract of De Veer’s work was given in Linschoten’s—
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">Descriptio totius Guineæ tractus, Congi, Angolæ, et Monomotapæ, eorumque locorum,

</p>
<p>Hagæ-Comitis. Ex officinâ Alberti Henrici. Anno 1599. folio.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The narrative of the Three Navigations to the North, which occupies nine pages, commences
at page 17, with the following head-title:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">Historia trium navigationum Batavorum in Septentrionem. Admirabilium ac nunquam ante
auditarum trium navigationum Batavorum in Septentrionales Oras detegendi Freti Vaygats
gratia, et in Novam Zemblam, per hactenus incognita Maria, fidelis relatio.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This abstract appears to have been made by Linschoten himself, as Camus states (p.
191) that this Latin edition of his works was translated by himself from the Dutch
of 1596.
</p>
<p>Although the description of Guinea, to which this abstract forms an appendix, has
a separate title-page and pagination, it is shown by the register to form part of—
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">Navigatio ac Itinerarium Johannis Hugonis Linscotani in Orientalem sive Lusitanorum
Indiam … Collecta … ac descripta per eundem Belgice, nunc vero Latine redditum Hagæ
Comitis ex officinâ Alberti Henrici. Impensis authoris et Cornelii Nicolai, prostantque
apud Ægidium Elsevirum. Anno 1599. Fol.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>From the circumstance of this abstract appearing at the end of Linschoten’s work,
it has been by some confounded with his narrative of his own two Arctic voyages.
</p>
<p><i>Dutch.</i> In 1646, another abstract of the original narrative appeared in the first volume
of the Dutch collection, entitled:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="nl">
<p class="first">Begin ende Voortgangh van de Vereenighde Nederlandtsche <span class="pageNum" id="pbclxx">[<a href="#pbclxx">clxx</a>]</span>Geoctroyeerde Oost-Indische Compagnie. 1646. obl. 4to.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>This important work, which is profusely illustrated, has no editor’s name or place
of imprint. It was, however, edited by Isaak Commelin, a learned Amsterdammer, and
printed at Amsterdam, as we learn from Chalmot’s <i lang="nl">Biographisch Woordenboek de Nederlanden</i>, in art. Commelin (Isaak). Chalmot had a good authority for this statement, namely,
Isaak Commelin’s son, Kasper, who, at page 866 of his <i lang="nl">Beschryvinge van Amsterdam</i>, declares his father to have been the editor, further mentioning that this and other
works were all printed at Amsterdam by Jansson.
</p>
<p>It was reprinted in 1648, under the following title:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="nl">
<p class="first">Verhael van de eerste Schip-vaert der Hollandische ende Zeeusche Schepen doer’t Way-gat

</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>And it re-appeared in 1650 with the same title. This work, though professing on the
title-page to be an account of the first voyage only, contains an account of the second
and third voyages also.
</p>
<p>Another Dutch abstract was printed by G.&nbsp;J. Saeghman at Amsterdam, in 1663, with the
following title:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="nl">

</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pbclxxi">[<a href="#pbclxxi">clxxi</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have not had an opportunity of seeing this work, and therefore cannot say whether
or not it is a reprint of the last-mentioned abstract. The fourth voyage of 1609 can
only be that of Henry Hudson, who undertook it at the instance of the Dutch East India
Company. The journal of this voyage, written by Robert Juet of Limehouse, “master’s
mate”, is given by Purchas in his “Pilgrimes”, vol. iii, pp. 581–595.
</p>
<p>An abstract of De Veer’s work is likewise contained in the first volume of the several
editions of Blaeu’s “Great Atlas”, which have been already described in page cxxv:
in the Latin at page 24; in the French at page 27; and in the Spanish at page 42.
The Dutch edition we have not seen.
</p>
<p><i>German.</i> A translation from Saeghman’s abstract appeared in 1675, in a collection by Rudolf
Capel, entitled, “Vorstellungen des Norden”. Hamburg, 1675, 4to.; in the fifth chapter
of which it is entered as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="de">
<p class="first">Die von den Holländern zu vier unterschiedenen mahlen, nemlich in Jahr c. 1594, 1595,

und Ost Indien. Auss der Niederländischen in die Hochteutsche Sprache übersetzet.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Another edition appeared in 1678.
</p>
<p>Another abstract in German was given in 1768, in Adelung’s <i lang="de">Geschichte der Schiffahrten</i>, published at Halle, 1768. In speaking of the great rarity of the original, Adelung
acknowledges himself obliged to make use of the summary in the French collection,
next described, which he collated with that of Capel.
</p>
<p><i>French.</i> The French collection to which we have just alluded, was edited by Constantin de
Renneville, under the title:—
</p>
<blockquote lang="fr">

vols. in 12mo.</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pbclxxii">[<a href="#pbclxxii">clxxii</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is an unacknowledged translation, with a slight alteration in the language at
the commencement of the work, from the Dutch collection already described, “Begin
ende Voortgangh,” etc.
</p>
<p><i>English.</i> In the year 1703, was published an English translation of the above abstract, which
was probably made from the French version by Renneville.
</p>
<p>A very brief summary of the three voyages is also given in the first volume of Harris’s
<i lang="la">Navigantium et Itinerantium Bibliotheca</i>, pp. 550–564. Lond. 1705. Fol.
</p>
<p>The winter’s residence of the Dutch in Novaya Zemlya has been repeatedly treated of
in various forms. The most recent work on the subject is probably a poem with the
title—
</p>
<blockquote lang="nl">
<p class="first">De Overwintering der Hollanders op Nova Zembla gedicht van Tollens, met Houtsneden

Suringar, 1843. 4to.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Of the English translation by Phillip, which forms the text of the present volume,
we are unable to speak in very favourable terms. Independently of a number of errors
resulting evidently from the want of a thorough acquaintance with the Dutch language,
the work is disfigured by numerous typographical errors, arising seemingly from the
circumstance that the translator placed his manuscript in the printer’s hands, and
never saw the work as it passed through the press. In the notes at the foot of the
text, in the present edition, these errors are corrected, and attention is drawn to
those cases in which subsequent writers, who merely consulted Phillip’s translation
of Purchas’s abridgement of it, have thereby been misled.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3896src" href="#xd33e3896" title="Go to note 205.">205</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pbclxxiii">[<a href="#pbclxxiii">clxxiii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides De Veer’s narrative, Phillip translated from the Dutch the three works mentioned
below.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e3911src" href="#xd33e3911" title="Go to note 206.">206</a> As one then who performed so much for the cause which it is the object of the Hakluyt

gives still no unapt representation of the simplicity and quaintness of its Dutch
original.

<p>The editor has already acknowledged the aid afforded to him by Mr. Vogel and Mr. Petermann.
He has now also to express his obligation to Mr. R.&nbsp;H. Major and Mr. W.&nbsp;B. Rye, of
the British Museum, for much valuable assistance in the bibliographical portions of
this Introduction. And he has further to record, that to his worthy friend and preceptor
in the Dutch language, Mr. John Bos,—who was employed by him to make a new translation
of De Veer’s text into English, in order that he might be spared the inconvenience
of collating the whole work in the Reading Room of the British Museum,—he is indebted
for much help in the preparation of the index at the end of this volume, and also
for many curious particulars of information which none but an old Amsterdammer could
well have supplied.

In Scoresby’s <i>Account of the Arctic Regions</i>, vol. i, p. 80, the spot reached by Rijp is called “the Bay of Birds”, De Bry being
referred to as the authority. But that writer’s words are—“<span lang="la">Sub gr. 80 circa Volucrium <i>Promontorium</i>, a quo postmodum animo ad Guilhelmum redeundi discessit.</span>”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Just as this sheet was going to press, we have found that the article in De Bry, from
which the above extract is taken, is a translation of the following work:—“<span lang="fr">Histoire du Pays nommé Spitsberghe. Comme il a esté descouvert, sa situation et de
ses Animauls. Avec le Discours des empeschemens que les Navires esquippes pour la
peche des Baleines tant Basques, Hollandois, que Flamens, ont soufferts de la part
des Anglois, en l’Année presente 1613. Escript par H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;A. Et une Protestation contre
les Anglois, &amp; annullation de tous leurs frivolz argumens, par lesquelz ils pensent
avoir droit de se faire seuls Maistres du dit Pays. A Amsterdam, chez Hessel Gerard
A. a l’ensiegne de la Carte Nautiq. <span class="sc">MD.C.XIII.</span></span>”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">This appears to be the work to which Purchas (vol. iii, p. 464) makes the following
allusion:—“I have by me a French Storie of Spitsbergh, published 1613 by a Dutchman,
which writeth against this English allegation, &amp;c., but hotter arguments then I am
willing to answer.” It gives an account of the voyage of Rijp and Barents, <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxiin">[<a href="#pbcxxxiin">cxxxii</a>]</span>which, though agreeing generally with that of De Veer, differs from it in some important
particulars. What is most remarkable is, that it is said to have been written by Barents
himself:—“<span lang="fr">Mais pour sçavoir deuvement ce qu’ils ont trouvé en ceste descouvrāce, i’ay trouvé
bon de mettre icy un petit extraict du Journal, <i>escrit de la main propre de Guillaume Bernard</i></span>”.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Want of time and space prevents us from giving the subject any lengthened consideration.
But from what we have been able to make out, our impression decidedly is, that it
was never written by Barents, but was attributed to him solely for the purpose of
giving to it an authority which it might otherwise not have possessed. For, in the
first place, Barents never returned to Holland subsequently to the discovery of Spitzbergen,
but died off the coast of Novaya Zemlya, on the 20th of June, 1597; so that, even
assuming him to have written a journal <i>with his own hand</i>, that journal must have passed into the possession of Gerrit de Veer, the historian
of the voyage, and would assuredly have formed the basis of his narrative; and hence
the discrepancies which exist between the two could never have arisen. And, in the
second place, this journal states, under date of the 24th of June, 1596, “<span lang="fr">la terre (au lōg du quel prenions nostre route) estoit la plus part rompue, bien hault,
et non autre que monts et montaignes agues, <i>parquoy l’appellions Spitzbergen</i></span>”. Yet, so far was Barents from having given this name to the newly-discovered country,
that we find it expressly stated by De Veer (p. 82), under date of the 22nd of June,
that they “esteemed this land to be <i>Greene-land</i>”. And not merely so, but after the latter’s return to Holland, where he had the opportunity
of consulting with Plantius and other geographers, he still retained that opinion;
for in the dedication to his work, which is dated “Amsterdam, April 29th, 1598”, he
says that “the eastern part of Greenland (<i>as we call it</i>) in 80°, is now ascertained, where it was formerly thought there was only water and
no land”; clearly proving that even at that time there was no idea of calling the
newly-discovered country by the name of Spitzbergen, or of considering it anything
but “the <i>eastern</i> part of Greenland”.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">But, not long afterwards, the <i>western</i> coast of Spitzbergen having been visited by the vessels of other nations, and its
importance as a station for the whale fishery having been ascertained, the Dutch were
naturally anxious to establish their claim to its first discovery. This was the object
of Hessel Gerard’s tract: a most legitimate one in itself, though, unfortunately,
carried out in a very unscrupulous manner. <span class="pageNum" id="pbcxxxiiin">[<a href="#pbcxxxiiin">cxxxiii</a>]</span>For, not only did he attribute the authorship of this journal to Barents, and in it
make him first use the name of Spitzbergen; but as, from the then prevailing ignorance
respecting the geography of that country, it was not possible to trace that navigator’s
true course along its <i>eastern</i> coast, round about its northern end, and so down the western coast, he did not scruple
to falsify Barents’s track, and make him sail from Bear Island on the 13th of June
sixteen Dutch miles <i>west</i>-north-<i>west</i> and fifteen miles north-<i>west</i>, where De Veer (p. 76) has sixteen miles north and <i>somewhat easterly</i>; and then again on the 14th, twenty-two miles north by <i>west</i>, where De Veer (p. 77) has twenty miles north and north and by <i>east</i>, and on the 16th thirty miles north and by <i>east</i>. By thus altering the direction of <span class="corr" id="xd33e3058" title="Source: Barent’s">Barents’</span> course, Gerard certainly brought him to the <i>western</i> coast of Spitzbergen; but he thereby rendered the remaining portion of the voyage,
which was westward <i>along the northern side of the land</i>, an impossible course <i>in the sea between Spitzbergen and Greenland</i>! The fact of Gerard’s tract having been republished in De Bry’s Collection, which
work is well known to literary men, while De Veer’s original journal has rarely, if
ever, been consulted by them, is doubtless the reason why the circumnavigation of
Spitzbergen by Barents and Rijp has hitherto remained unknown.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e2993src" title="Return to note 157 in text.">↑</a></p>

when speaking (p. 257) of the bears which were killed by the Dutch while in their
winter quarters, says that on opening one of them “there was found in its stomach
‘part of a buck, with the hair and skinne and all, which not long before she had torne
<span class="pageNum" id="pbclxxiiin">[<a href="#pbclxxiiin">clxxiii</a>]</span>and devoured,’ a fact (he adds) which I mention only to rectify an error in supposing
deer did not frequent Nova Zembla.”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Did the fact of the existence of deer in Novaya Zemlya rest upon this statement alone,
it would have but a weak foundation; for, as is shown in page 182, note 3, the original
Dutch is “stucken van <i>robben</i>, met huijt ende hayr”—“pieces of <i>seals</i>, with the skin and hair.” But, in truth, the existence of deer in that country is
established by the incontrovertible evidence adduced in the notes to pages 5, 83,
and 104; to which has to be added the fact recorded in the Appendix, p. 269, that
when Hudson and his crew were on the coast of Novaya Zemlya in 1608, they saw there
numerous signs of deer, and on one occasion “a herd of white deere of ten in a companie;”
so that they actually gave to the place the name of Deere Point.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e3896src" title="Return to note 205 in text.">↑</a></p>

<h2 class="main">NOTICE.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The accompanying Map, which has been reproduced by Mr. F. Muller of Amsterdam, is
issued to Members of the Hakluyt Society, to be bound up with the volume containing
the Three Voyages of Barents. It is the first Map on which the track of Barents, in
his third voyage, is shown.
</p>
<p>The Map is stated (on legends at the top, and also at the foot—to the right) to have
been drawn by Willem Barents himself (“<span lang="la">Auctore Wilhelmo Bernardo</span>”). It was probably drawn by him at his winter quarters in Novaya Zembya, and brought
home by Heemskerk. The legend at the foot further states that the map was engraved
by Baptista-a-Doetichem, probably a son of Lucas-a-Doetichem, who engraved the plate
of the funeral of Charles V, in 1558. The thirty-six plates in the tenth edition of
Linschoten’s <i lang="la">Itinerarium</i>, were all engraved by the son Baptista, of Doetichem, which is a small town in Guelderland.
</p>
<p>In the same legend it is added “<span lang="la">Cornelius Nicolai excudebat.</span>” The Dutch name of this publisher is Cornelius Claeszoon. He was the celebrated publisher
at Amsterdam who published the three editions of Linschoten’s <i lang="la">Itinerarium</i> in 1595 and 1604, in Dutch. In 1599 he brought out an abridged Latin translation,
in the second part of which is inserted a short narrative of the Arctic Expedition;
quite distinct from the larger work written by Linschoten, and published in 1601 by
Gerard Ketel at Franeker in Friesland, with entirely different maps, and without a
narrative of the Arctic voyage.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, clear that the map was first published in 1599 by Cornelius Claeszoon
(who was also publisher of the Journal of De Veer), in the second part of the abridged
Latin edition of Linschoten’s <i lang="la">Itinerarium</i>; but it is wanting in some copies of this second part.

<h2 class="main xd33e4068">THE FYRST PART<br>
OF THE<br>
NAUIGATION INTO THE NORTH SEAS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is a most certaine and an assured assertion, that nothing doth more benefit and
further the common-wealth (specially these countries<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4108src" href="#xd33e4108" title="Go to note 1.">1</a>) then the art and knowledge of nauigation, in regard that such countries and nations
as are strong and mightie at sea, haue the meanes and ready way to draw, fetch, and
bring vnto them for their maintenaunce, all the principalest commodities and fruites
of the earth, for that thereby they are inabled to bring all necessary things for
the nourishment and sustentation of man from the vttermost partes of the world, and
to carry and conuay such wares and marchendizes <span class="right-marginnote">As the art of nauigation more increaseth, so there are daily more new countries found
out.</span> whereof they haue great store and aboundance vnto the same places, which by reason
of the art of nauigation, and the commodities of the sea, is easily to be effected
and brought to passe. Which nauigation as it dayly more and more increaseth (to the
great woonder and admiration of those, that compare the sea-faring and nauigation
vsed in our forefathers times, yea and that also that hath beene practised in our
age, with that which now at this present is daily furthered and sought out), so there
are continually new <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>voiages made, and strange coasts discouered; the which <span class="marginnote">Diligence and continuance effect that which is sought.</span> although they be not done by the first, secōd, or third voiage, but after, by tract
of time, first brought to their full effect, and desired commoditie, and the fruits
thereof, by continuance of time reaped. Yet we must not be abasht, nor dismayed, at
the labour, toile, trauaile, and dāgers sustayned in such uoiages, to that end made,
although as I said <span class="marginnote">We must not leaue of by some mens dislike or dispraise in our proceedings.</span> before the benefit thereof be not had nor seene in the first, second, third, or more
uoiages; for what labour is more profitable, and worthier praise and commendation,
then that which tendeth vnto the common good and benefit of all men; Although such
as are vnskilfull, contemners, and deriders of mens diligence and proceedings therein,
at the first esteeme it an vnprofitable and needlesse thing, when as the end prooueth
beneficiall and commodious. If the famous nauigators Cortesius, Nonius, and Megalanes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4123src" href="#xd33e4123" title="Go to note 2.">2</a> and others, that in their times sought out and discovered the kingdomes, countries,
and ilands farre distant from vs, in the extreamest parts of the world, for the first,
second, or third voyage, that had succeeded vnfortunately with them, had left off
and giuen ouer their nauigatiō, they had not afterward reaped nor enioyed the fruites,
benefits, and commodities thereof. <span class="marginnote">A thing not continued, can not be effected.</span> Alexander magnus (after he had woone all Grecia, and from thence entred into little
and great Asia, and comming to the farthest parts of India, there found some difficultie
to passe) sayd, If we had not gone forward, and persisted in our intent, which other
men esteemed and held to be impossible, we had still remayned and stayed in the entry
of Cilicia,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4133src" href="#xd33e4133" title="Go to note 3.">3</a> where <span class="marginnote">All things are effected in convenient time.</span> as now we haue ouerrunne and past through all those large and spacious countries:
for nothing is found and effected <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>all at one time, neither is any thing that is put in practise, presently brought to
an end. To the which end, Cicero wisely saith, God hath giuen vs some things, and
not all things, that our successours also might have somewhat to doe. Therefore we
must not leaue off, nor stay our pretence in the middle of our proceedings, as long
as there is any commoditie to be hoped, and in time to be obtayned: for that the greatest
and richest treasures are hardliest to be found. But to make no long digression from
our matter, concerning the dayly furtheraunce of the most necessarie and profitable
art of nauigation, that hath been brought to full effect, not without great charges,
labour, and paines; ouerslipping and not shewing with how long and troublesome labour
and toyle, continually had, the passages to the East and West Indies, America, Brasilia,
and other places, through the straight of Magellanes, in the South Sea, twise or thrise
passing vnder the Line,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4141src" href="#xd33e4141" title="Go to note 4.">4</a> and by those meanes other countries and ilands, were first found out and discouered.
</p>
<p>Let vs looke into the White Seas,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4148src" href="#xd33e4148" title="Go to note 5.">5</a> that are now so commonly sayled (on the north side of Muscouia), with what cumbersome
labour and toyle they were first discouered: What hath now made this voyage so common
and easie? is <span class="right-marginnote">That which in the beginning is hard, by continuance of time is made easie and light.</span> it not the same, and as long a voyage as it was, before it was fully knowne and found
out? I,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4156src" href="#xd33e4156" title="Go to note 6.">6</a> but the right courses, which at the first were to be sought, by crossing the seas
from one land to another, and are now to be held aloofe <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>into the seas and directly sayled, hath, of difficult and toylesome, made them easie
and ready voyages.
</p>
<p>This small discourse I thought good to set downe, for an introduction vnto the reader,
in regard that I haue vndertaken to describe the three voyages made into the North
Seas, in three yeares, one after the other, behind Norway, and along and about Muscouia,
towardes the kingdome of Cathaia and China: whereof the two last I myself holpe to
effect;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4174src" href="#xd33e4174" title="Go to note 7.">7</a> and yet brought them not to the desired end that we well hoped.
</p>
<p>First, to shew our diligent and most toylesome labour and <span class="marginnote">The first finding is hard, but the second attempt is easier.</span> paynes taken, to find out the right course; which we could not bring to passe, as
we well hoped, wished, and desired, and possible might haue found it, by crossing
the seas, if we had taken the right course; if the ice and the <span class="corr" id="xd33e4184" title="Source: shortnessc">shortnesse</span> of time, and bad crosses had not hindered vs: and also to stoppe their mouthes, that
report and say, that our proceeding therein was wholly vnprofitable and fruitelesse;
which peraduenture in time to come, may turne vnto our great profite and commoditie.
For he which proceedeth and continueth in a thing that seemeth to be impossible, is
not to be discommended: but hee, that in regarde that the thing seemeth to be impossible,
doth not proceed therein, but by his faint heartedness and sloath, wholly leaueth
it off.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Not the nearness of the North Pole, but the Ice in the Tartarian sea, causeth the
greatest cold.</span> Wee haue assuredly found, that the onely and most hinderaunce to our voyage, was
the ice, that we found about Noua Zembla,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4191src" href="#xd33e4191" title="Go to note 8.">8</a> vnder 73, 74, 75, and 76 degrees; and not so much vpon the sea betweene both the
landes:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4198src" href="#xd33e4198" title="Go to note 9.">9</a> whereby <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>it appeareth, that not the nearenesse of the North Pole, but the ice that commeth
in and out from the Tartarian Sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4203src" href="#xd33e4203" title="Go to note 10.">10</a> about Noua Zembla, caused vs to feele the greatest cold. Therefore in regard that
the nearenesse of the Pole was not the cause of the great cold that we felt, if we
had had the meanes to haue held our appoynted and intended course into the north-east,
we had peraduenture found some enteraunce: which course we could not hold from Noua
Zembla, because that there we entred amongst great store of ice; and how it was about
Noua Zembla, we could not tell, before we had sought it; and when we had sought it,
we could not then alter our course, although also it is vncertaine, what we should
have done, if we had continued in our north-east course, because it is not yet found
out. But it is true, that in the countrie lying vnder 80 degrees,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4209src" href="#xd33e4209" title="Go to note 11.">11</a> (which we esteeme to be Greenland) there is both leaues and grasse to be seene; wherein,
such beastes as feed of leaues and grasse, (as hartes, hindes, and such like beastes)
liue: whereas to the contrary in Noua Zembla, there groweth nether leaues nor grasse,
and there are no beastes therein but such as eate flesh,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4213src" href="#xd33e4213" title="Go to note 12.">12</a> as beares, and foxes, &amp;c.; although Noua Zembla lyeth 4, 5, and 6 degrees more southerly
from the Pole, then the other land aforesaid. It is also manifest, that vpon <span class="right-marginnote">Comparison of the heate under the line, with the cold under the North Pole.</span> the south and north side of the line of the sunne on both sides, between both the
tropicos, vnder 23 degrees and a halfe, it is as hot as it is right vnder the Line.
What <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>wonder then should it be, that about the North Pole also, and as many degrees on both
sides, it should not bee colder then right vnder the Pole? I will not affirme this
to bee true, because that the colde on both sides of the North Pole hath not as yet
beene discouered and sought out, as the heat on the north and south side of the Line
hath beene. Onely thus much I will say, that although we held not our direct pretended<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4230src" href="#xd33e4230" title="Go to note 13.">13</a> course to the north-east, that therefore it is to be iudged, that the cold would
haue let our passage through that way, for it was not the sea, nor the neerenesse
vnto the Pole, but the ice about the land, that let and hindered vs (as I sayd before)
for that as soon as we made from the land, and put more into the sea, although it
was much <span class="marginnote">The resolute intent and opinions of William Barents.</span> further northward, presently we felt more warmth; and in yt opinion our pilote William
Barents<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4236src" href="#xd33e4236" title="Go to note 14.">14</a> dyed, who notwithstanding the fearful and intollerable cold that he endured, yet
he was not discouraged, but offered to lay wagers with diuers of us, that by Gods
helpe he would bring that pretended voiage to an end, if he held his course north-east
from the North Cape. But I will leaue that, and shewe you of the three voyages aforesaid,
begun and set forth by the permission and furtherance of the generall States of the
vnited Prouinces, and of Prince Maurice, as admirall of the sea, and the rich towne
of Amsterdam. Whereby the reader may iudge and conceaue what is to bee done, for the
most profite and advantage, and what is to be left.
</p>
<p>First you must understand, that in anno 1594 there was 4 ships set foorth out of the
vnited Prouinces, whereof two were of Amsterdam, one of Zelandt, one of Enckhuysen,
that were appointed to saile into the North Seas, to discouer the kingdomes of Cathaia,
and China, north-ward from <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>Norway, Muscouia, and about Tartaria; whereof William Barents, a notable skilfull
and wise pilote, was commander ouer the ships of Amsterdam, and with them vpon Whit-sunday<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4243src" href="#xd33e4243" title="Go to note 15.">15</a> departed from Amsterdam and went to the Texel.
</p>
<p>Upon the fifth of June they sailed out of the Texel, and hauing a good wind and faire
weather, vpon the 23 of June, they arrived at Kilduin in Muscouia,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4248src" href="#xd33e4248" title="Go to note 16.">16</a> which for that it is a place well knowen and a common voyage, I will make no further
discription thereof.
</p>
<p>The 29 of June, at foure of the clocke in the after noone, they set saile out of Kilduin,
and so 13 [52] or 14 [56] miles<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4253src" href="#xd33e4253" title="Go to note 17.">17</a> out-right sailed north-east, with a north north-west wind, and close weather.
</p>
<p>The 30 of June they sayled east north-east 7 [28] miles, till the sunne was east south-east
[about half-past six o’clock in the morning],<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4258src" href="#xd33e4258" title="Go to note 18.">18</a> with a north wind, with 2 schower sailes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4261src" href="#xd33e4261" title="Go to note 19.">19</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>there they cast out their lead, at 100 fadome deepth, but found no ground.
</p>
<p>From whence the same day they sailed east north-east<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4270src" href="#xd33e4270" title="Go to note 20.">20</a> 5 [20] miles, till the sunne was full south [¾ past 10, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], hauing the wind north, with 2 schower sailes, where once againe they cast out the
lead 100 fadome deepe, but found no ground; and then from noone to night<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4278src" href="#xd33e4278" title="Go to note 21.">21</a> the same day, they sailed east, and east and by north 13 [52] miles, till the sunne
was north-west [¼ past 7, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and there casting out their lead, they had ground at 120 fadome, the ground being
oasie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4286src" href="#xd33e4286" title="Go to note 22.">22</a> and blacke durt.
</p>
<p>The 1 of July, after they had sailed one quarter<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4292src" href="#xd33e4292" title="Go to note 23.">23</a> 4 [16] miles east, and east and by north, early in the morning they cast out the
lead, and found ground at 60 fadome, where they had an oasie small sandy ground; and
within an houre after they cast out the lead againe, and had ground at 52 fadome,
being white sande mixed with blacke, and some-what oasie: after that they had sailed
3 [12] miles east and by north, where they had ground at 40 fadome, being gray sand
mixed with white. From thence they sailed 2 [8] miles east-ward, with a north north-east
winde, there they had ground at 38 fadome, being red sand mixed with black, the sunne
being south-east and by east [¼ past 7, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>]. From thence they sailed 3 [12] miles, east and by south, and east south-east til
noone, where they had the sunne at 70 degrees and ¾,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4300src" href="#xd33e4300" title="Go to note 24.">24</a> there they cast out the lead againe, and had ground at 39 fadome, being small gray
sand, mixed with blacke stippellen<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4304src" href="#xd33e4304" title="Go to note 25.">25</a> and pieces of shels.
</p>
<p>Then againe they sailed 2 [8] miles south-east, and then <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>woond<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4311src" href="#xd33e4311" title="Go to note 26.">26</a> northward with an east north-east wind, and after sailed 6 [24] miles north-east
all that day,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4316src" href="#xd33e4316" title="Go to note 27.">27</a> with a south-east wind, till the sunne was north north-west [¼ past 9 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], the weather being cold; and the lead being cast foorth they found ground at 60
fadome, being small gray oasie sand, mixed with a little blacke, and great whole shels:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4324src" href="#xd33e4324" title="Go to note 28.">28</a> after that the same euening to the first quarter,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4330src" href="#xd33e4330" title="Go to note 29.">29</a> they sailed 5 [20] miles, east north-east, and north-east and by east, and after
that east north-east, and north-east and by east 5 [20] miles, vntill the second of
July in the morning, and there they had 65 fadome deepe, the ground oasie with black
slime or durt.
</p>
<p>The same day from morning till noone, they sailed 3 [12] or 4 [16] miles east north-east,
the wind blowing stiffe south-east, whereby at noone they were forced to take<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4337src" href="#xd33e4337" title="Go to note 30.">30</a> in the fore-saile, and driue with a schower saile,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4342src" href="#xd33e4342" title="Go to note 31.">31</a> in mistie weather, for the space of 3 [12] or 4 [16] miles, vntill euening, holding
east, and east and by south: after that the winde blew south-west, and about 5 of
the clocke in the after-noone, they cast out the lead, but had no ground at 120 fadome.
That euening the weather cleared vp againe, and they sailed about 5 [20] miles before
the wind, east north-east, for the space of 3 houres, and then againe it began to
be mistie, so that they durst not saile forward, but lay hulling in the wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4347src" href="#xd33e4347" title="Go to note 32.">32</a> where vpon Sunday morning being the 3 of July, when the sunne was north-east [½ p.
1, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], they cast out the lead and found ground at 125 fadome, being black durt or slime.
</p>
<p>From thence they sailed 8 [32] miles east north-east, till <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>the sunne was south-east [½ p. 7, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and casting out the lead, found ground at 140 fadom, being blacke slimie durt,
at which time they tooke the high of the sun and found it to be 73 degrees and 6 minutes,
and presently againe they cast out the lead, and had 130 fadome deepth, the ground
being blacke slime. After that they sayled 6 [24] or 7 [28] miles further east north-east,
till the sunne was north-west [½ p. 7, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>].
</p>
<p>On Sunday in the morning, being the 3 of July, it was very faire and cleare weather,
the wind blowing south-west, at which time William Barents found out the right meridien,
taking the high of the sunne with his crosse-staffe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4367src" href="#xd33e4367" title="Go to note 33.">33</a> when it was south-east, and found it to be eleuated in the south-east 28 degrees
and a halfe, and when it had passed ouer west and by north, it was but<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4378src" href="#xd33e4378" title="Go to note 34.">34</a> 28 degrees and a half aboue the horizon, so that it differed 5 points and a half,
which being deuided there rested 2 points and ¾; so that their compasse was altered
2 points and ¾, as it appeared the same day, when the sunne was in her higth, betweene
south south-west and south-west and by south, for the sun was south-west and by south,
and yet was not declined, and they had 73 degrees and 6 minutes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 4 of July in the morning, they sailed 4 [16] miles east and by north, and casting
out the lead found ground at 125 fadome, being slimie. That night the weather was
mistie againe, and in the morning the wind was east; then they sailed 4 [16] miles
south-east and by south, till the sunne was east [½ p. 4, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and then againe they cast out the lead, and found ground at 108 fadome, black durt;
then they wound north-ward, and sailed 6 [24] miles, north north-east, and north-east
and by north, vntill the sunne was south south-west [¾ p. 11, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and then they saw the land of Noua Zembla, lying south-east and by east 6 [24]
or 7 [28] miles from them, where they had black durty ground at 105 fadome. Then they
woond southward againe, and sailed 6 [24] miles, south and by west, till the sunne
was west north-west [5, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], there they had 68 fadome deepe, with durtie ground as before, the wind being south-east.
</p>
<p>Then they woond east-ward and sailed 6 [24] miles east and by south, at which time,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4400src" href="#xd33e4400" title="Go to note 35.">35</a> William Barents took the height of the sunne with his crosse-staffe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4405src" href="#xd33e4405" title="Go to note 36.">36</a> when it was at the lowest, that is between north north-east and east and by north,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4410src" href="#xd33e4410" title="Go to note 37.">37</a> and found it to bee eleuated aboue the horizon 6 degrees and ⅓ part, his declination
being 22 degrees and 55 minutes, from whence substracting the aforesaid <span class="corr" id="xd33e4415" title="Source: heigth">height</span>, there resteth 16 degrees and 35 minutes, which being substracted from 90 degrees,
there resteth 73 degrees and 25 minutes; which was when they were about 5 [20] or
6 [24] miles from the land of Noua Zembla.
</p>
<p>Then they woond east-ward and sailed 5 [20] miles, east and by south, and east south-east,
and past by a long point of land that lay out into the sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4420src" href="#xd33e4420" title="Go to note 38.">38</a> which they named Langenes: <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>and hard by that point east-ward there was a great bay, where they went a land with
their boate, but found no people.
</p>
<p>Three [12] or foure [16] miles from Langenes east north-east, there lay a long<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4431src" href="#xd33e4431" title="Go to note 39.">39</a> point, and a mile [4 miles] east-ward from the said point there was a great bay,
and upon the east side of the said bay, there lay a rock not very high aboue the water,
and on the west side of the bay, there stood a sharpe little hill, easie to be knowne:
before the bay it was 20 fadome deepth, the ground small blacke stones, like pease:
from Langenes to Cape Bapo<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4436src" href="#xd33e4436" title="Go to note 40.">40</a> east north-east it is 4 [16] miles.
</p>
<p>From Cape Bapo to the west point of Lombsbay north-east and by north are 5 [20] miles,
and betweene them both there are 2 creekes. Lombsbay is a great wide bay, on the west
side thereof hauing a faire hauen 6, 7, or 8, fadome deepe, black sand: there they
went on shore with their boate, and vpon the shore placed a beacon, made of an old
mast which they found there; calling the bay Lombsbay, because of a certaine kind
of beares<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4443src" href="#xd33e4443" title="Go to note 41.">41</a> so called, which they found there in great aboundance.
</p>
<p>The east point of Lombsbay is a long narrow point, and by it there lyeth an island,
and from that long point to seaward <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>in, there is a great creeke.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4470src" href="#xd33e4470" title="Go to note 42.">42</a> This Lombsbay lyeth vnder 74 degrees and ⅓ part. From Lombsbay to the point of the
Admirals Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4481src" href="#xd33e4481" title="Go to note 43.">43</a> they sailed 6 [24] or 7 [28] miles, north-east and by north. The Admirals Island
is not very faire on<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4486src" href="#xd33e4486" title="Go to note 44.">44</a> the east side, but a farre off very flat, so that you must shunne it long before
you come at it; it is also very vneuen, for at one casting off the lead they had 10
fadome deepe, and presently at another casting of the lead they had but 6 fadome,
and presently after that againe 10, 11, and 12 fadome, the streame running hard against
the flats.
</p>
<p>From the east end of the Admirals Island, to Cape Negro,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4493src" href="#xd33e4493" title="Go to note 45.">45</a> that is the Black Pointe, they sailed about 5 [20] or 6 [24] miles, east north-east;
and a mile [4 miles] without the Black Point it is 70 fadome deepe, the ground slimie,
as vpon Pamphius:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4497src" href="#xd33e4497" title="Go to note 46.">46</a> right eastward of the Blacke Point, there <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>are 2 sharpe pointed hills in the creeke, that are easie to be knowen.
</p>
<p>The 6 of July, the sunne being north [½ p. 10, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], they came right before the Blacke Point with faire weather: this Blacke Point lyeth
vnder 75 degrees and 20 minutes. From the <span class="corr" id="xd33e4511" title="Source: Placke">Blacke</span> Point to Williams Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4514src" href="#xd33e4514" title="Go to note 47.">47</a> they sailed 7 [28] or 8 [32] miles, east north-east, and between them both about
halfe a mile<span id="xd33e4518"></span> [2 miles]<span class="corr" id="xd33e4520" title="Not in source">,</span> there lay a small island.
</p>
<p>The 7 of July they sailed from Williams Island, and then William Barents tooke the
height of the sunne with his cross-staffe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4524src" href="#xd33e4524" title="Go to note 48.">48</a> and found it to be eleuated aboue the horizon<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4529src" href="#xd33e4529" title="Go to note 49.">49</a> in the south-west and by south 53 degrees and 6 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4532src" href="#xd33e4532" title="Go to note 50.">50</a> his declination being 22 degrees and 49 minutes, which being added to 53 degrees
and 6 minutes, make 75 degrees and 55 minutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4535src" href="#xd33e4535" title="Go to note 51.">51</a> This is the right height of the pole of the said island. In this island they found
great store of driff-wood, and many sea-horses, being a kinde of fish<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4538src" href="#xd33e4538" title="Go to note 52.">52</a> that keepeth in the sea, having very great teeth, which at this day are vsed insteed
of iuorie or elephants teeth: there also is a good road for ships, at 12 and 13 fadome
deep, against all winds, except it be west south-west and west windes; and there they
found a piece of a Russian ship,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4544src" href="#xd33e4544" title="Go to note 53.">53</a> and that day they had the wind east north-east, mistie weather.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 9 of July they entered into Beeren-fort,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4550src" href="#xd33e4550" title="Go to note 54.">54</a> vpon the road vnder Williams Island, and there they found a white beare, which they
perceiuing, presently entered into their boate, and shot her into the body with a
musket; but the beare shewed most wonderfull strength, which almost is not to be found
in any beast, for no man euer heard the like to be done by any lyon or cruel beast
whatsoeuer: for notwithstanding that she was shot into the bodie, yet she leapt vp,
and swame in the water, the men that were in the boate rowing after her, cast a rope
about her necke, and by that meanes drew her at the sterne of the boat, for that not
hauing seene the like beare before, they thought to haue carryed her aliue in the
shippe, and to have shewed her for a strange wonder in Holland; but she vsed such
force, that they were glad that they were rid of her, and contented themselves with
her skin only, for she made such a noyse, and stroue in such sort, that it was admirable,
wherewith they let her rest and gave her more scope with the rope that they held by
her, and so drew her in that sort after them, by that meanes to wearie her: meane
time, William Barents made neerer to her,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4570src" href="#xd33e4570" title="Go to note 55.">55</a> but the beare swome to the boate, and with her fore-feet got hold of the sterne thereof,
which William Barents perceiuing, said, She will there rest her selfe; but she had
another meaning, for she vsed such force, that at last she had gotten half her body
into the boat, wherewith the men were so abashed, that they run into y<sup>e</sup> further end of the boate, and thought verily to have been spoiled by her, but by
a strange means they were deliuered from her, for that the rope that was about her
necke, caught hold vpon the hooke of the ruther, whereby the beare could get no further,
but <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>so was held backe, and hanging in that manner, one of the men boldly stept foorth
from the end of the scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4580src" href="#xd33e4580" title="Go to note 56.">56</a> and thrust her into the bodie with a halfe-pike; and therewith she fell downe into
the water, and so they rowed forward with her to the ship, drawing her after them,
till she was in a manner dead, wherewith they killed her out-right, and hauing fleaed
her, brought the skinne to Amsterdam.
</p>
<p>The 10 of July,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4587src" href="#xd33e4587" title="Go to note 57.">57</a> they sailed out of Beren-fort <span class="corr" id="xd33e4591" title="Source: fro">for</span> Williams Island, and the same day in the morning got to the Island of Crosses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4594src" href="#xd33e4594" title="Go to note 58.">58</a> and there went on land with their pinnace, and found the island to bee barren, and
full of cliffes and rocks, in it there was a small hauen, whereinto they rowed with
their boat. This island is about halfe a mile [2 miles] long, and reacheth east and
west; on the west end it hath a banke, about a third part of a mile [1⅓ mile] long,
and at the east end also another banke: vpon this island there standeth 2 great crosses;
the island lyeth about 2 [8] long miles from the firme land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4599src" href="#xd33e4599" title="Go to note 59.">59</a> and vnder the east-end thereof there is good road at 26 fadome, soft ground;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4602src" href="#xd33e4602" title="Go to note 60.">60</a> and somewhat closer to the island on the strand, at 9 fadome, sandy ground.
</p>
<p>From the Island of Crosses to the point of Cape Nassawe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4609src" href="#xd33e4609" title="Go to note 61.">61</a> they sailed east, and east and by north, about 8 [32] miles: it is a long<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4614src" href="#xd33e4614" title="Go to note 62.">62</a> flat point which you must be carefull to shunne, for thereabouts at 7 fadome there
were flats or sholes, very farre from the land: it lyeth almost under 76 degrees and
a halfe. From the west end of Williams Island to the Island with the Crosses is 3
[12] miles, the course north.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4619src" href="#xd33e4619" title="Go to note 63.">63</a>
</p>
<p>From Nassaw Point they sailed east and by south, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>east south-east 5 [20] miles, and then they thought that they saw land in north-east
and by east,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4628src" href="#xd33e4628" title="Go to note 64.">64</a> and sailed towards it 5 [20] miles north-east to discrie it, thinking it to be another
land, that lay northward from Noua Zembla; but it began to blow so hard out of the
west, that they were forced to take in their marsaile,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4633src" href="#xd33e4633" title="Go to note 65.">65</a> and yet the wind rose in such manner, that they were forced to take in all their
sailes, and the sea went so hollow, that they were constrained to driue 16 houres
together without saile, 8 [32] or 9 [36] miles east north-east.
</p>
<p>The 11 of July their boat was by a great wave of the sea sunke to the ground, and
by that meanes they lost it, and after that they drave without sailes 5 [20] miles,
east and by south; at last, the sunne being almost south-east [½ p. 7, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], the wind came about to the north-west, and then the weather began somewhat to clear
up, but yet it was very mistie. Then they hoysed vp their sailes againe and sailed
4 [16] miles till night, that the sunne was north and by east [11, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and there they had 60 fadome deepth, muddie ground, and there they saw certaine
flakes of ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4646src" href="#xd33e4646" title="Go to note 66.">66</a> at which time vpon the 12 of July they woond west, and held north-west, and sailed
about a mile [4 miles] with mistie weather, and a north-west wind, and sailed up and
downe west south-west 3 [12] or 4 [16] miles to see if they could find their boat
againe: after that they wound againe with the wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4651src" href="#xd33e4651" title="Go to note 67.">67</a> and sayled 4 [16] miles south-east, till the sunne was south-west <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>[1, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and then they were close by the land of Noua Zembla, that lay east and by north,
and west and by south; from thence they wound ouer againe till noone, and sayled 3
[12] miles north and by west; and then, till the sunne was north-west [¾ p. 6, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], they held north-west and by north 3 [12] miles; then they wound east-ward and sailed
4 [16] or 5 [20] miles north-east and by east.
</p>
<p>The 13 of July at night, they found great store of ice, as much as they could descrie
out of the top, that lay as if it had been a plaine field of ice;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4667src" href="#xd33e4667" title="Go to note 68.">68</a> then they wound west-ward ouer from the ice, and sailed about 4 [16] miles west south-west,
till the sunne was east and by north [5 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and that they saw the land of Noua Zembla, lying south south-east from them.
</p>
<p>Then they wound north-ward againe and sailed 2 [8] miles, till the sunne was east
south-east [½ p. 6, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and then againe found great store of ice, and after that sailed south-west and
by south 3 [12] miles.
</p>
<p>The 14 of July they wound northward againe, and sayled with 2 schower sailes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4688src" href="#xd33e4688" title="Go to note 69.">69</a> north and by east, and north north-east 5 [20] or 6 [24] miles, to the height of
77 degrees <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>and ⅓ part,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4693src" href="#xd33e4693" title="Go to note 70.">70</a> and entred againe amongst the ice, being so broad that they could not see ouer it,
there they had no ground at 100 fadome, and then it blew hard west north-west.
</p>
<p>From thence they wound south-ward, and sailed south south-west 7 [28] or 8 [32] miles,
and came againe by the land, that shewed to be 4 or 5 high hilles. Then they wound
northward, and till euening sayled north 6 [24] miles, but there againe they found
ice.
</p>
<p>From thence they wound south-ward, and sailed south and by west 6 [24] miles, and
then againe entred into ice.
</p>
<p>The 15 of July, they wound south-ward againe, sayling south and by west 6 [24] miles,
and in the morning were by the land of Noua Zembla againe, the sunne being about north-east
[½ p. 1, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>].
</p>
<p>From thence they wound north-ward againe, and sayled north and by east 7 [28] miles,
and entred againe into the ice. Then they wound south-ward againe, the sunne being
west [¾ p. 3, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and sailed south south-west, and south-west and by south 8 [32] or 9 [36] miles,
vpon the 16 of July.
</p>
<p>From thence they wound north-ward, and sailed north and by east 4 [16] miles; after
that againe they wound west-ward, and sailed west and by south 4 [16] miles, and then
they sailed north north-west 4 [16] miles, and then the wind blew north north-east,
and it froze hard; this was upon the 17 of July.
</p>
<p>Then they wound east-ward, and sailed east till noone, 3 [12] miles, and after that
east and by south 3 [12] miles; from thence about euening they wound northward and
sailed north and by east 5 [20] miles, till the 18 of July in the morning; then they
sailed north and by west 4 [16] miles, and there entred againe amongst a great many
flakes of <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4714src" href="#xd33e4714" title="Go to note 71.">71</a> from whence they wound southward, and close by the ice they had no groūd at 150 fadom.
</p>
<p>Then they sayled about 2 houres south-east, and east south-east, with <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: mistie">mystie</span> weather, and came to a flake of ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4724src" href="#xd33e4724" title="Go to note 72.">72</a> which was so broad that they could not see ouer it, it being faire still weather,
and yet it froze, and so sailed along by the ice 2 houres; after that it was so mistie,
that they could see nothing round about them, and sailed south-west two [8] miles.
</p>
<p>The same day William Barents tooke the height of the sun with his astrolabium, and
then they were under 77 degrees and a ¼ of the Pole,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4731src" href="#xd33e4731" title="Go to note 73.">73</a> and sailed south-ward 6 [24] miles, and perceiued the firme land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4734src" href="#xd33e4734" title="Go to note 74.">74</a> lying south from them.
</p>
<p>Then they sailed till the 19 of July in the morning, west south-west, 6 [24] or 7
[28] miles, with a north-west wind and mistie weather; and after that south-west and
south-west and by west 7 [28] miles, the sunne being 77 degrees 5 minutes lesse.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4739src" href="#xd33e4739" title="Go to note 75.">75</a> Then they sailed 2 [8] miles south-west, and were close by the land of Noua Zembla,
about Cape Nassaue.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4742src" href="#xd33e4742" title="Go to note 76.">76</a>
</p>
<p>From thence they wound north-ward and sailed north 8 [32] miles, with a west north-west
wind and a mist, and till the 20 of July in the morning north-east and by north 3
[12] or 4 [16] miles; and when the sunne was east [½ p. 4, <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] they wound west, and till euening sailed south-west 5 [20] or 6 [24] miles, with
mistie weather, and then south-west and by south 7 [28] miles, till the 21 of July
in the morning.
</p>
<p>Then they wound north-ward againe, and from morning <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>till euening sailed north-west and by west 9 [36] miles, with mistie weather, and

south south-west 3 [12] miles, with mistie weather, and till euening south and by
west, 9 [36] miles, all mistie weather.
</p>
<p>After that they wound north-ward againe, and sailed north-west and by north 3 [12]
miles, and then 2 [8] miles north-west;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4765src" href="#xd33e4765" title="Go to note 78.">78</a> and in the morning being the 23 of July the wind blew north-west, and then they cast
out the lead, and had 48 fadome muddie ground.
</p>
<p>Then they sailed 2 [8] miles north north-east and north and by east, and 2 [8] miles
north-east, at 46 fadome deepe; after that they wound west-ward, and sailed west and
by north 6 [24] miles; there it was 60 fadome deepe, muddy ground.

<p>Then they wound eastward and sailed 3 [12] miles east and by north; then againe 9
[36] or 10 [40] miles east, and east and by south; and after that 5 [20] or 6 [24]
miles east, and east and by south; and after that 5 [20] or 6 [24] miles more, east
and by south, till euening, being the 24 of July; then againe 4 [16] miles south-east
and by east, the wind being east north-east.
</p>
<p>Then they woond north-ward, and till the 25 of July in the morning sailed north, and
north and by west, 4 [16] miles; there they had 130 fadome deepe, muddie ground; then
they sailed north-ward, where they had 100 fadome deepe, and there they saw the ice
in the north-east; and then againe they sailed 2 [8] miles, north and by west.
</p>
<p>Then they woond south-ward towards the ice, and sailed south-east one mile [4 miles];
after that they wound north-ward againe, and sailed north 6 [24] miles, and were so
inclosed about with flakes of ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4777src" href="#xd33e4777" title="Go to note 79.">79</a> that out of the top they <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>could not discerne any thing beyond it, and sought to get through the ice, but they
could not passe beyond it, and therefore in the evening they wound south-ward againe,
and sailed along by the ice, south and west by 5 [20] miles, and after that south
south-east 3 [12] miles.
</p>
<p>The 25 of July at night, they took the <span class="corr" id="xd33e4786" title="Source: heigth">height</span> of the sunne, when it was at the lowest between north and north-east,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4789src" href="#xd33e4789" title="Go to note 80.">80</a> and north-east and by north, it being eleuated aboue the horizon 6 degrees and ¾,
his declinatiō being 19 degrees 50 minutes; now take 6 degrees ¾ from 19 degrees and

</p>
<p>The 26 of July, in the morning, they sailed 6 [24] miles south south-east, till the
sunne was south-west [1, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and then south-east 6 [24] miles, and were within a mile of the land of Noua Zembla,
and then wound north-ward from the land, and sailed 5 [20] miles north-west<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4803src" href="#xd33e4803" title="Go to note 82.">82</a> with an east wind; but in the euening they wound south-ward againe, and sailed south
south-east 7 [28] miles, and were close by the land.
</p>
<p>Then they wound north-ward againe, and sailed north north-east 2 [8] or 3 [12] miles;
from thence they wound south-ward, and sailed south south-east 2 [8] or 3 [12] miles,
and came againe to Cape Trust.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4812src" href="#xd33e4812" title="Go to note 83.">83</a>
</p>
<p>Then they wounde againe from the land, north-east, about halfe a mile [2 miles], and
were ouer against the sandes of 4 fadome deepe, betweene the rocke and the land, and
there the sands were 10 fadome deepe, the ground being small black stones; then they
sailed north-west a little while, till they had 43 fadome deepe, soft ground.
</p>
<p>From thence they sailed north-east 4 [16] miles, upon the <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>27 of July, with an east south-east wind, and wound south-ward againe, where they
found 70 fadome deepe, clay ground, and sayled south and south and by east 4 [16]
miles, and came to a great creek; and a mile and a halfe [6 miles] from thence there
lay a banke of sande of 18 fadome deepe, clay sandy ground, and betweene that sand
or banke and the land it was 60 and 50 fadome deepe, the coast reaching east and west
by the compasse.
</p>
<p>In the euening they wound [stife<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4829src" href="#xd33e4829" title="Go to note 84.">84</a>] north-ward, and sailed 3 [12] miles north north-east; that day it was mistie, and
in the night cleare, and William Barents tooke the height of the sunne with his crosse-staffe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4832src" href="#xd33e4832" title="Go to note 85.">85</a> and found it to be eleuated aboue the horizon 5 degrees 40 minutes, his declination
being 19 degrees 25 minutes, from whence substracting 5 degrees 40 minutes, there
resteth 13 degrees 45 minutes, which substracted from 90 rested 76 degrees 31 minutes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4837src" href="#xd33e4837" title="Go to note 86.">86</a> for the height of the Pole.
</p>
<p>Upon the 28 of July, they sailed 3 [12] miles north north-east, and after that wound
south-ward, and sailed 6 [24] miles south south-east, and yet were then 3 [12] or
4 [16] miles from the land.
</p>
<p>The 28 of July, the height of the sun being taken at noone with the <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: astrolabiū">astrolobiū</span>, it was found to be eleuated aboue the horizon 57 degrees and 6 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4847src" href="#xd33e4847" title="Go to note 87.">87</a> her declination being 19 degrees and 18 minutes, which in all is 76 degrees and 24
minutes, they being then about 4 [16] miles from the land of Noua Zembla, that lay
all couered ouer with snow, the weather being cleare, and the wind east.
</p>
<p>Then againe, the sunne being about south-west [1, <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>they wound north-ward, and sailed one mile [4 miles] north north-east, and then wound
againe, and sailed another mile [4 miles] south-east, then they wound north-ward againe,
and sailed 4 [16] miles north-east and north-east and by north.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4857src" href="#xd33e4857" title="Go to note 88.">88</a>
</p>
<p>The same day<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4866src" href="#xd33e4866" title="Go to note 89.">89</a> the height of the sunne being taken, it was found to be 76 degrees and 24 minutes,
and then they sailed north-east 3 [12] miles, and after that north-east and by east
4 [16] miles, and vpon the 29 of July came into the ice againe.
</p>
<p>The 29 of July the height of the sunne being taken with the crosse-staffe, astrolabium,
and quadrant,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4875src" href="#xd33e4875" title="Go to note 90.">90</a> they found it to bee eleuated aboue the horizon 32 degrees, her declination being
19 degrees, which substracted from 32 there resteth 13 degrees of the equator, which
being substracted from 90 there rested 77 degrees; and then the neerest north point
of Noua Zembla, called the Ice Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4879src" href="#xd33e4879" title="Go to note 91.">91</a> lay right east from them.
</p>
<p>There they found certaine stones that glistered like gold, which for that cause they
named gold-stones,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4888src" href="#xd33e4888" title="Go to note 92.">92</a> and there also they had a faire bay with sandy ground.
</p>
<p>Upon the same day they wound south-ward againe, and sailed south-east<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4899src" href="#xd33e4899" title="Go to note 93.">93</a> 2 [8] miles betweene the land and the ice, and after that from the Ice Point east,
and to the south-ward<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4906src" href="#xd33e4906" title="Go to note 94.">94</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>6 [24] miles to the Islands of Orange; and there they laboured forward<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4913src" href="#xd33e4913" title="Go to note 95.">95</a> betweene the land and the ice, with faire still weather, and vpon the 31 of July
got to the Islands of Orange. And there went to one of those islands, where they found
about 200 walrushen or sea-horses, lying upon the shoare to baske<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4920src" href="#xd33e4920" title="Go to note 96.">96</a> themselues in the sunne. This sea-horse is a wonderfull strong monster of the sea,
much bigger then an oxe, which keepes continually in the seas, hauing a skinne like
a sea-calfe or seale, with very short hair, mouthed like a lyon, and many times they
lie vpon the ice; they are hardly killed vnlesse you strike them iust vpon the forehead;
it hath foure feet, but no eares, and commonly it hath one or two young ones at a
time. And when the fisher-men chance to find them vpon a flake of ice<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4926src" href="#xd33e4926" title="Go to note 97.">97</a> with their yong ones, shee casteth her yong ones before her into the water, and then
takes them in her armes, and so plungeth vp and downe with them, and when shee will
reuenge herselfe vpon the boats, or make resistance against them, then she casts her
yong ones from her againe, and with all her force goeth towards the boate; whereby
our men were once in no small danger, for that the sea-horse had almost stricken her
teeth into the sterne of their boate, thinking to ouerthrowe it; but by means of the
great cry that the men made, shee was afraid, and swomme away againe, and tooke her
yong ones againe in her armes. They haue two teeth sticking out of their mouthes,
on each side one, each beeing about halfe an elle long, and are esteemed to bee as
good as any iuorie or elophants teeth, specially in Muscouia, Tartaria, and there
abouts where they are knowne, for they are as white, hard, and euen as iuory.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4931src" href="#xd33e4931" title="Go to note 98.">98</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>Those sea-horses that lay basking<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4954src" href="#xd33e4954" title="Go to note 99.">99</a> themselues vpon the land, our men, supposing that they could not defend themselues
being out of the water, went on shore to assaile them, and fought with thē, to get
their teeth that are so rich, but they brake all their hatchets, curtle-axes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4959src" href="#xd33e4959" title="Go to note 100.">100</a> and pikes in pieces, and could not kill one of them, but strucke some of their teeth
<span class="corr" id="xd33e4986" title="Source: ont">out</span> of their mouthes, which they tooke with them; and when they could get nothing against
them by fighting, they agreed to goe aboard the ship, to fetch some of their great
ordinance, to shoot at them therewith; but it began to blow so hard, that it rent
the ice into great <span class="sic">peices</span>, so that they were forced not to do it; and therewith they found a great white beare
that slept, which they shot into the body, but she ranne away, and entred into the
water; the men following her with their boat, and kil’d her out-right, and then drew
her vpon the ice, and so sticking a half pike vp-right, bound her fast vnto it, thinking
to fetch her when they came backe againe, to shoot at the sea-horses with their ordinance;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>but for that it began more and more to blow, and the ice therewith brake in peeces,
they did nothing at all.
</p>
<p>After that W. Barents had begun this uoyage vpon the fifth of June, 1594, and at that
time (as I sayd before) set saile out of the Texell, the 23 of the same month arriving
at Kilduin in Muscouia, and from thence tooke his course on the north side of Noua
Zembla, wherein he continued till the first of August, with such aduentures as are
before declared, till he came to the Island of Orange:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4995src" href="#xd33e4995" title="Go to note 101.">101</a> after he had taken all that paine, and finding that he could hardly get through,
to accomplish and ende his pretended<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e4999src" href="#xd33e4999" title="Go to note 102.">102</a> voyage, his men also beginning to bee weary and would saile no further, they all
together agreed to returne back againe, to meet with the <span class="right-marginnote">Theire returne backe againe.</span> other ships<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5005src" href="#xd33e5005" title="Go to note 103.">103</a> that had taken their course to the Weygates, or Straights of Nassawe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5008src" href="#xd33e5008" title="Go to note 104.">104</a> to know what discoueries they had made there.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first of August they turned their course to saile backe againe from the Islands
of Orange, and sailed west and west by south 6 [24] miles to the Ice Point.
</p>
<p>From the Ice Point to the Cape of Comfort,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5087src" href="#xd33e5087" title="Go to note 105.">105</a> they sailed west and somewhat south 30 [120] miles: betweene them both there lyeth
very high land, but the Cape of Comfort is very low flat land, and on the west end
thereof there standeth foure or fiue blacke houels or little hilles like country houses.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5092src" href="#xd33e5092" title="Go to note 106.">106</a>
</p>
<p>Upon the 3 of August, from the Cape of Comfort they <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>wound north-ward, and sailed 8 [32] miles north-west and by north, and north north-west;
and about noone they wound south-ward till euening, and sailed south and by west,
and south-south-west 7 [28] miles, and then came to a long narrow point of land one
Cape Nassaw.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5102src" href="#xd33e5102" title="Go to note 107.">107</a>
</p>
<p>In the euening they wound north-ward againe, and sailed north and by east 2 [8] miles;
then the winde came north, and therefore they wound west-ward againe, and sailed north
north-west one mile [4 miles]; then the wind turned east, and with that they sailed
from the 4 of August in the morning till noone west and by north 5 [20] or 6 [24]
miles; after that they sailed till euening south-west 5 [20] miles and after that
south-west 2 [8] miles more, and fell vpon a low flat land, which on the east-end
had a white patche or peece of ground.
</p>
<p>After that they sailed till morning, being the 5 of August, west south-west 12 [48]
miles,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5110src" href="#xd33e5110" title="Go to note 108.">108</a> then south-west 14 [56] miles, and then west 3 [12] miles till the 6 of August.
</p>
<p>The 6 of August they sailed west south-west 2 [8] or 3 [12] miles; then south-west,
and south-west and by south, 4 [16] or 5 [20] miles; then south-west and by west 3
[12] miles, and then south-west and by west 3 [12] miles; and after that west south-west
and south-west and by south 3 [12] miles, till the 7 of August.
</p>
<p>The 7 of August till noone they sailed 3 [12] miles west south-west, then 3 [12] miles
west, and then they wound south-ward till euening, and sailed 3 [12] miles south-east
and south-east and by east, then againe west south-west 2 [8] miles, after that they
sailed south 3 [12] miles, till the 8 of August in the morning, with a west south-west
winde.
</p>
<p>The 8 of August they sailed south-east and by south 10 [40] miles, and then south-east
and by east vntil euening 5 <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>[20] miles, and then came to a low flat land, that lay south-west and by south, and
north-east and by north, and so sailed 5 [20] miles more, and there they had 36 fadome
deepe, 2 [8] miles from the land, the ground blacke sand; There they sailed towards
the land, till they were at 12 fadome, and halfe a mile [2 miles] from the land it
was stony ground.
</p>
<p>From thence the land reacheth south-ward for 3 [12] miles, to the other low point
that had a blacke rocke lying close by it; and from thence the land reacheth south
south-east 3 [12] miles, to another point; and there lay a little low island from
the point, and within halfe a mile [2 miles] of the land it was flat ground, at 8,
9, and 10 fadome deepe, which they called the Black Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5122src" href="#xd33e5122" title="Go to note 109.">109</a> because it showed blacke aboue; then it was very mistie, so that they lay in the
wind<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5126src" href="#xd33e5126" title="Go to note 110.">110</a> and sailed 3 [12] miles west north-west; but when it cleared vp, they wound towards
the land againe, and the sunne being south [¼ to 11 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], they came right against the Blacke Island, and had held their course east south-east.
</p>
<p>There W. Barents tooke the height of the sunne, it being vnder 71 degrees and ⅓; and
there they found a great creeke, which William Barents iudged to be the place where
Oliuer Brunel<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5136src" href="#xd33e5136" title="Go to note 111.">111</a> had been before, called Costincsarth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5140src" href="#xd33e5140" title="Go to note 112.">112</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>From the Blacke Island, they sailed south and south and by east to another small<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5219src" href="#xd33e5219" title="Go to note 113.">113</a> point 3 [12] miles, on which point there stood a crosse, and therefore they called
it the Crosse Point;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5224src" href="#xd33e5224" title="Go to note 114.">114</a> there also there was a flat bay, and low water,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5228src" href="#xd33e5228" title="Go to note 115.">115</a> 5, 6, or 7 fadome deep, soft ground.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5233src" href="#xd33e5233" title="Go to note 116.">116</a>
</p>
<p>From Crosse Point they sailed along by the land south south-east 4 [16] miles, and
then came to another small<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5240src" href="#xd33e5240" title="Go to note 117.">117</a> point, which behinde it had a great creeke, that reached east-ward: this point they
called the Fifth Point or S. Laurence <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>Point.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5248src" href="#xd33e5248" title="Go to note 118.">118</a> From the Fifth Point they sailed to the Sconce Point<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5252src" href="#xd33e5252" title="Go to note 119.">119</a> 3 [12] miles, south south-east, and there lay a long blacke rocke close by the land,
whereon there stood a crosse; then they entered into the ice againe, and put inward
to the sea<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5264src" href="#xd33e5264" title="Go to note 120.">120</a> because of the ice. Their intent was to saile along the coast of Noua Zembla to the
Wey-gates, but by reason that the ice met them they wound west-ward, and from the
9 of August in the euening, till the 10 of August in the morning, sayled west and
by north 11 [44] miles, and after that 4 [16] miles west north-west, and north-west
and by west, the winde being north; in the morning<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5270src" href="#xd33e5270" title="Go to note 121.">121</a> they wound east-warde againe, and sailed vntill euening 10 [40] miles east and east
and by south; after that east and east and by north 4 [16] miles, and there they saw
land, and were right against a great creeke, where with their boat they went on land,
and there found a faire hauen 5 fadome deepe, sandy ground. This creeke on the north
side hath 3 blacke points, and about the 3 points<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5275src" href="#xd33e5275" title="Go to note 122.">122</a> lyeth the road, but you must keepe somewhat from the 3 point, for it is stonie, and
betweene the 2 and 3 point there is another faire bay, for north-west, north, and
north-east winds, blacke sandy ground. This bay they called S. Laurence Bay, and there
they tooke the height of the sunne, which was 70 degrees and ¾.
</p>
<p>From S. Laurence Bay, south south-east 2 [8] miles to Sconce Point, there lay a long<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5284src" href="#xd33e5284" title="Go to note 123.">123</a> blacke rocke, close by the land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5289src" href="#xd33e5289" title="Go to note 124.">124</a> whereon there stood a crosse; there they went on land <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>with their boat, and perceiued that some men had bin there, and that they were fled
to saue themselues;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5299src" href="#xd33e5299" title="Go to note 125.">125</a> for there they found 6 sacks with rie-meale buried in the ground, and a heap of stones

there also lay a broken Russia ship,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5335src" href="#xd33e5335" title="Go to note 130.">130</a> the keele thereof being 44 foot long, but they could see no man on the land: it is
a faire hauen for all winds, which they called the Meale-hauen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5341src" href="#xd33e5341" title="Go to note 131.">131</a> because of the meale that they found there.
</p>
<p>From the black rocke or cliffe with the crosse, 2 [8] miles south south-east, there
lay a low island a little into the sea, from whence they sailed 9 [36] or 10 [40]
miles south south-east; <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>there the height of the sunne<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5357src" href="#xd33e5357" title="Go to note 132.">132</a> was 70 degrees and 50 minutes, when it was south south-west.
</p>
<p>From that island they sailed along by the land 4 [16] miles south-east and by south;
there they came to 2 islands, whereof the uttermost lay a mile [4 miles] from the
land; those islands they called S. Clara.
</p>
<p>Then they entered into the ice again, and wound inward to sea, in the wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5365src" href="#xd33e5365" title="Go to note 133.">133</a> and sailed from the island<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5370src" href="#xd33e5370" title="Go to note 134.">134</a> vntill evening, west south-west 4 [16] miles, the wind being north-west; that evening
it was very mistie, and then they had 80 fadom deepe.
</p>
<p>Then againe they sailed south-west and by west, and west south-west 3 [12] miles;
there they had 70 fadome deepe, and so sayled till the thirteenth of August in the
morning, south-west and by west foure [16] miles; two houres before they had ground
at fiftie sixe fadome, and in the morning at fortie five fadome, soft muddy ground.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then they sayled till noone sixe [24] miles south-west, and had twentie foure fadome
deepe, black sandie ground; and within one houre after they had two and twentie fadome
deepe, browne reddish sand; then they sailed sixe [24] miles south-west, with fifteene
fadome deepe, red sand; after that two [8] miles south-west, and there it was fifteene
fadome deepe, red sand, and there they sawe land, and sayled forward south-west untill
evening, till we were within halfe a mile [2 miles] of the land, and there it was
seven fadome deepe, sandy ground, the land being low flat downes reaching east and
west.
</p>
<p>Then they wound from the land and sailed north, and north and by east 4 [16] miles;
from thence they wound to land againe, and sayled til the 14 of August 5 [20] or 6
[24] miles south-west, sailing close by the land, which (as they gesse<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5381src" href="#xd33e5381" title="Go to note 135.">135</a>) was the island of Colgoyen;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5384src" href="#xd33e5384" title="Go to note 136.">136</a> there they sailed by the lād east-ward 4 [16] miles; after that 3 [12] miles east,
and east and by south; then the weather became mistie, whereby they could not see
the land, and had shallow flat water<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5387src" href="#xd33e5387" title="Go to note 137.">137</a> at 7 or 8 fadome; then they took in the marsaile<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5392src" href="#xd33e5392" title="Go to note 138.">138</a> and lay in the wind<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5397src" href="#xd33e5397" title="Go to note 139.">139</a> till it was cleare weather againe, and then the sunne was south south-west [¾ p.
11 a.m.], yet they could not see the land: there they had 100 fadome deepe, sandy
ground; then they sailed east 7 [28] miles; after that againe 2 [8] miles east south-east,
and south-east and by east; and againe till the 15 of August in the morning, 9 [36]
miles east south-east; then from morning till noone they sailed 4 miles east south-east,
and sailed over a flat or sand of 9 or 10 fadome deepe, sandy ground, but could see
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>no land; and about an houre before noone it began to waxe deeper, for then wee had
12 and 13 fadome water, and then wee sayled east south-east 3 [12] miles, till the
sunne was south-west [1 p.m.].
</p>
<p>The same daye the sunne being south-west,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5407src" href="#xd33e5407" title="Go to note 140.">140</a> William Barents tooke the height thereof, and found it to be elevated above the horizon
35 degrees, his declination being 14 degrees and ¼, so y<sup>t</sup> as there wanted 55 degrees of 90, which 55 and 14 degrees and ¼ being both added
together, made 69 degrees 15 minutes, which was the height of the Pole in that place,
the wind being north-west; then they sailed 2 [8] miles more east-ward, and came to
the islands called Matfloe and Delgoy,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5413src" href="#xd33e5413" title="Go to note 141.">141</a> and there in the morning they meet with the other shippes of their company, being
of Zelandt and Enck-huysen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5418src" href="#xd33e5418" title="Go to note 142.">142</a> that came out of Wey-gates the same day; there they shewed each other where they
had bin, and how farre each of them had sailed, and discouered.
</p>
<p>The ship of Enck-huysen had past the straights of Wey-gates, and said, that at the
end of Wey-gates he had found a large sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5423src" href="#xd33e5423" title="Go to note 143.">143</a> and that they had sailed 50 [200] or 60 [240] miles further east-ward, and were of
opinion that they had been about the riuer of Obi,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5430src" href="#xd33e5430" title="Go to note 144.">144</a> that commeth out of Tartaria, and that the land of Tartaria reacheth north-east-ward
againe from thence, whereby they thought that they were not far <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>from Cape Tabin,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5443src" href="#xd33e5443" title="Go to note 145.">145</a> which is y<sup>e</sup> point<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5454src" href="#xd33e5454" title="Go to note 146.">146</a> of Tartaria, that reacheth towards the kingdom of Chathai, north-east and then south-ward.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5459src" href="#xd33e5459" title="Go to note 147.">147</a> And so thinking that they had discouered inough for that time, and that it was too
late in the yeare to saile any further, as also that their commission was to discouer
the scituation, and to come home againe before winter, they turned againe towards
the Wei-gates, and came to an island about 5 miles great, lying south-east from Wei-gates
on the Tartarian side, and called it the States Island;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5466src" href="#xd33e5466" title="Go to note 148.">148</a> there they found many stones, that were of a cristale mountaine,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5473src" href="#xd33e5473" title="Go to note 149.">149</a> being a kind of diamont.
</p>
<p>When they were met together (as I sayd before) they made signes of ioy, discharging
some of their ordinance, and were merry, the other shippes thinking that William Barents
had sailed round about Noua Zembla, and had come backe againe through the Wei-gates:
and after they had shewed each other what they had done, and made signs of ioy for
their meeting, they set their course to turne backe againe for Holland; and vpon the
16 of August they went vnder the islands of Matfloe and Delgoy, and put into the road,
because the wind was north-west, and lay there till the 18 of August.
</p>
<p>The 18 of August they set saile, and went forward west north-west, and almost west
and by north, and so sailed 12 [48] miles; and then west and by south 6 [24] miles,
and came to a sand of scarce 5 fadome deepe, with a north-west wind; and in the evening
they wound northward, and sailed east north-east 7 [28] or 8 [32] miles, the wind
being <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>northerly; and then they wound westward, and sailed till the 19 of August in the morning,
west 2 [8] miles; then 2 [8] miles south-west, and after that 2 [8] miles south-east;
there they wound west-ward againe, and sailed till evening with a calme, and after
that had an east winde, and at first sailed west north-west, and north-west and by
west 6 [24] or 7 [28] miles, and had ground at 12 fadome: then till the 20 of August
in the morning, they sayled west north-west, and north-west and by west, 7 [28] miles
with an easterly wind; and then againe sailed west north-west, and north-west and
by west 7 [28] miles; then west north-west 4 [16] miles, and draue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5483src" href="#xd33e5483" title="Go to note 150.">150</a> forward till euening with a calme: after that they sailed west north-west and north-west
and by west 7 [28] miles, and in the night time came to a sand of 3 fadome deepe right
against the land, and so sailed along by it, first one mile north, then 3 [12] miles
north north-west, and it was sandy hilly land, and many points:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5488src" href="#xd33e5488" title="Go to note 151.">151</a> and then sailed on forward with 9 or 10 fadome deepe, along by the land till noone,
being the 21 of August, north-west 5 [20] miles; and the west point of the land, called
Candinaes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5493src" href="#xd33e5493" title="Go to note 152.">152</a> lay north-west<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5498src" href="#xd33e5498" title="Go to note 153.">153</a> from them 4 [16] miles.
</p>
<p>From thence they sailed 4 [16] miles north north-west, and then north-west and by
north 4 [16] miles, and 3 [12] miles more north-west, and north-west and by north,
and then north-west 4 [16] miles, til the 22 of August in the morning: and that morning
they sailed north-west 7 [28] miles, and so till euening west north-west and north-west
and by west 15 [60] miles, the wind being north; after that 8 [32] miles more, west
north-west; and then till the 23 of August at noone, west north-west 11 [44] miles,
the same day at noone the sunne was eleuated aboue the horizon 31 <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>degrees and ⅓ part, his declination was 11 degrees and ⅔ partes; so that it wanted
58 degrees and ⅔ of 90 degrees, and adding the declination being 11 degrees ⅔ to 58
degrees and ⅔ partes, then the height of the Pole was 70 degrees and ⅓ part: then
they sailed north-west, and north-west and by west, till euening 8 [32] miles; and
then north-west and by west, and west north-west 5 [20] miles; and then vntill the
24 of August in the morning, north-west and by west 6 [24] miles; after that west,
and west south-west 3 [12] miles, and then passed close by the island of Ware-huysen<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5508src" href="#xd33e5508" title="Go to note 154.">154</a> in the roade. From Ware-huysen hither-ward, because the way is well knowne, I neede
not to write thereof, but that from thence they sailed altogether homeward, and kept
company together till they came to the Texel, where the ship of Zelandt <span class="right-marginnote">The end of this voyage</span> past by, and William Barents with his pinnace came vpon a faire day,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5516src" href="#xd33e5516" title="Go to note 155.">155</a> being the 16 of September, before Amsterdam, and the ship of Enck-huysen to Enck-huysen,
from whence they were set foorth. William Barents’ men brought a sea-horse to Amsterdam,
being of a wonderfull greatnesse, which they tooke vpon a flake of ice, and killed
it.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd33e4258src" title="Return to note 18 in text.">18</a></span> A rude way of determining the time by the bearing of the sun, customary among seamen
of all nations in those days, for want of portable time-pieces. Were the precise azimuth
of the sun observed, no method could be more exact; but as no interval between the
several points of the compass (which are 11° 15′ apart) is taken into account, and
as the sun’s bearing is also subject to the variation of the compass, the result must
be only approximative. From the compass-bearing alone, as recorded, it would be difficult
for the reader to form anything like a correct idea of the actual time—for example,
when, on the 30th of June, the sun was observed to be full south, it wanted more than
an hour-and-a-quarter of mid-day. It is, therefore, deemed advisable to insert, after
each observation of time by the sun, the time by the clock to the nearest quarter
of an hour.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e4258src" title="Return to note 18 in text.">↑</a></p>

seamen on the east coast of Africa still employ a primitive instrument, which is essentially
the same. It consists of a small quadrangular board, through which a string, knotted
at various distances, is passed; each knot being at such a distance from the board,
that when the latter is held by the observer before him, with the knot between his
teeth and the string extended, the board (between its upper and lower edges) shall
subtend the angle at which the pole-star is known to be elevated above the horizon

may be, yet if, instead of a knotted string, a notched stick were used, on which the
board might slide backwards and forwards, it would be the cross-staff of our early

there in great numbers. They are large in the body and small in the wing, so that
it is surprising how their little wings can carry their heavy bodies. They have their
nests on steep rocks, <span class="pageNum" id="pb13n">[<a href="#pb13n">13</a>]</span>in order to be secure from animals, and they sit on only one egg at a time. They were

seen. One of the ships resorting to Smeerenberg for the fishery, put to sea on one
occasion, when no whales were seen, persevered westward to a considerable length,
and accidentally fell in with some immense flakes of ice, which, on his return to
his companions, he described as truly wonderful, and as resembling fields in the extent
of their surface. Hence the application of the term ‘field’ to this kind of ice. The
discoverer of it was distinguished by the title of ‘field finder’.”—Vol. i, p. 243.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e4667src" title="Return to note 68 in text.">↑</a></p>

it is not at all improbable that it may have afforded foundation for some of the stories

have sought its explanation in their own language, in which <i lang="nl">waaien</i> means “to blow”, “to be windy”, and <i lang="nl">gat</i> is “a strait” or “passage”; so that <i lang="nl">waaigat</i> would be “a passage wherein the wind blows strongly”. And it is indisputable that
this name has, on various occasions, been so applied by the seamen of that nation.
Thus, we find a <i lang="nl">Waaigat</i> in Baffin’s Bay, one in Spitzbergen, and another by the Straits of Magellan; and
even the roads between the Helder and Texel have, from an early period, borne the
same name. See “Prize Essay on the Netherlandish Discoveries,” by R.&nbsp;G. Bennet and
J.&nbsp;G. van Wijk, in <i lang="nl">Nieuwe Verhandelingen von het Provincial Utrechtsche Genootschap, etc.</i>, vol. vi (1827), p. 41.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Others, instead of the Dutch <i lang="nl">waaien</i>, have taken the German <i lang="de">weihen</i> as the root, and thus made <i lang="de">weihgat</i> to mean the “sacred straits”.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">J.&nbsp;R. Forster, in his <i>Voyages and Discoveries in the North</i> (Engl. edit.), p. 273, contends, however, that the name is of Russian origin, and
explains it as follows:—“Barentz found afterwards in Nova Zembla some carved images
on a head-land near the straits, in consequence of which he called it <i lang="nl">Afgoeden-hoek</i>, the ‘Cape of Idols’. Now, in the Sclavonian tongue, <i>wajat</i> means ‘to carve’, ‘to make an image’. <i>Wajati-Noss</i> would, therefore, <span class="pageNum" id="pb28n">[<a href="#pb28n">28</a>]</span>be the ‘Carved’ or ‘Image Cape’; and this seems to me to be the true origin of the
word <i>Waigats</i>, which properly should be called <i>Waja­telstwoi Proliw</i>, ‘the Image Straits’.” So convinced was Forster of the correctness of his conjecture,
that in another part of his work (p. 413) he did not hesitate to assert that the Russians
themselves give to the <span lang="nl">Afgoeden-hoek</span> the name of Waijati Nos; and this strange derivation of the word Waigats has found
supporters not only among foreign, but even among Russian writers. See <i>Barrow</i>, p. 137; <i>Berch</i>, p. 30.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">But Lütke, who has fully investigated the subject, adduces as proof against these
fanciful etymologies, first (p. 30), that the name recorded by the Dutch themselves
is Waigatz [Weygats], and not Waigat, the Russian termination <i>tsch</i> being changed by them into <i>tz</i>, in the same way as in Pi<i>tz</i>ora for Pe<i>tsch</i>ora, etc.; secondly, that the name Waigatsch properly belongs to the island alone,
and not to the straits; thirdly, that this name was known to the Englishman Burrough
in 1556, nearly forty years before the first voyage of the Hollanders; and lastly
(p. 31), that the Russians have never called the Cape of Idols Waiyati Nos, but always
Bolwánskyi Muis, from <i>bolwàn</i>, a rough image.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Lütke adds that the true derivation of the name in question is as difficult to be
determined as that of Kolguew, Nokuew, Kildin, Warandei, etc., which are probably
the remains of the languages of tribes now extinct. But, at the same time, he directs
attention to Witsen’s assertion (which appears to have been altogether overlooked
by previous writers), that the island of Waigatsch received its name from one Iwan
Waigatsch—“<span lang="nl">het Eiland Waigats, dat zijn naem heeft van Ivan, of Ian Waigats;</span>”—a derivation which is very probable, and certainly far more reasonable than any
of the etymologies above recited.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e5008src" title="Return to note 104 in text.">↑</a></p>

This name, which has scarcely ever been written
twice alike, and which has given occasion to so much speculation as to its origin,
is properly <i>Kostin-schar</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, “Kostin Straits, or Passage”; it being the channel by which the Meyduscharski Island
(<i>i.e.</i>, “the island lying between the straits”), is separated from <span class="pageNum" id="pb31n">[<a href="#pb31n">31</a>]</span>the main land of Novaya Zemlya. Lütke, from whom (p. 22) the above definition is taken,
explains further (p. 245), that “among Novaya Zemlya navigators, <i>schar</i> is properly the name of a strait or passage, which goes directly through or across
an island or country, forming a communication between two distinct seas. For one that
merely separates an island from the mainland, or otherwise forms part of one sea alone,
the appropriate designation is <i>salma</i>. Thus, Matotschkin Schar, Yugorskyi Schar, etc., are properly so called; but Kostin
Schar, as a walrus hunter told me, ‘is styled a <i>schar</i> only through stupidity, as its correct designation would be <i>Kostin Salma</i>’.”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Nevertheless, in justice to those who first gave the name of Kostin <i>Schar</i> to this strait, it must be remarked, that it was regarded by them as actually passing
through the mainland of Novaya Zemlya, and as forming a communication with the Kara
Sea. It is thus shown in the early maps; and Witzen (p. 918) expressly states—“<span lang="nl">Het ys dryft <i>door Nova Zemla</i> heen, <i>en comt by Constint Sarch</i>, of Constantin Zaar, <i>uit</i>.</span>”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">It is the passage to the south of the island which is more especially named Kostin
Schar, or Kostin Salma. That to the north is the Podryésof Passage (Podrjesow Schar).
See <i>Lütke</i>, p. 315.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">As regards the etymology of the word <i>Schar</i>, Lütke says (p. 245) that he was unable to satisfy himself. “The Samoyedes themselves
regard it as a foreign term; and by some it is thought to come from the Finnish word
<i>Schar</i> or <i>Skar</i>.” Can the <i>shard</i> of Spencer have any connection with it?

316), speaks of a tradition, according to which this was formerly the residence of
some natives of Novogorod of that name. These settlers are not mentioned in the chronicles,
nor is anything known respecting them, or the date or cause of their emigration. <span class="pageNum" id="pb34n">[<a href="#pb34n">34</a>]</span>But assuming the remains found by Barentsz and his companions to be those of the Strogonovs,
he deems it not unreasonable to place their arrival some twenty or thirty years earlier
than the visit of the Hollanders; which date would correspond with the reign of John
the Terrible (<span lang="ru-Latn">Yoan Grosnui</span>), a period when the Novogoroders had the greatest reason to emigrate into the regions
far distant from their native country. Indeed, it is not improbable that some of them
may, at that time, have been banished to Novaya Zemlya. Lütke adds: “It is worthy
of remark that our walrus-hunters give the name of Meal Cape to the western headland
of Strogonov Bay; which name would seem to have originated in the six sacks of rye-meal
which Barentz saw there. The remains of the dwellings of the Strogonovs lie close
to Meal Cape.”—P. 317.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The same writer adverts also, but with disfavour, to the further tradition, that “the
Strogonovs were visited by certain monsters with iron noses and teeth”. But when it
is considered that the walrus must have been previously unknown to these natives of
Novogorod, it is not unreasonable to imagine that animal to have given rise to what
might otherwise well be regarded as a fable.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e5341src" title="Return to note 131 in text.">↑</a></p>

wherein the snow lyes so deepe, that the sunne cannot shine upon the ground, by reason
that the high hilles keepe the sunne from shining on them. So it is (as I iudge) with
the ice in the Tartarian Seas, which is also called the Ice Sea, about Noua Zembla,
where the ice that commeth into those seas out of the riuers that are in Tartaria
and Cathaia, can not melt, by reason of the great quantitie thereof, and for that
the sun sheweth not high aboue those places, and therefore casteth not so great a
heat, as it can easily melt: which is the cause that the ice lyeth there still, as
the snowe doth in the hilles of Spaine aforesayd, and that the sayd ice maketh it
farre colder there, then it is a greate deal neerer the Pole in the large seas;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5575src" href="#xd33e5575" title="Go to note 8.">8</a> and although those places that are not discouered, cannot bee so well described as

<p>In anno 1595, the generall States of the vnited prouinces, and Prince Maurice, caused
seuen shippes to bee prepared to sayle through the Wey-gates, or the Straights of
Nassaue,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5590src" href="#xd33e5590" title="Go to note 10.">10</a> to the kingdome of Cathaia and China: two out of Amsterdam, two out of Zelandt, two
out of Enck-huysen, and one out of Roterdam: sixe of them laden with diuers kindes
of wares, marchandizes, and with money, and factors to sell the said wares; the seuenth
beeing a pinace, that had commission, when the other shippes were past about the Cape
de Tabin<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5597src" href="#xd33e5597" title="Go to note 11.">11</a> (which is the furthest point of Tartaria), or <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>so farre that they might saile foorth southward without any let or hinderance of the
ice, to turne backe againe, and to bring newes thereof. And I being in William Barents
ship, that was our chiefe pilote,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5602src" href="#xd33e5602" title="Go to note 12.">12</a> and James Hems-kerke chiefe factor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5606src" href="#xd33e5606" title="Go to note 13.">13</a> thought good to write downe the same in order as it is here after declared, as I
did the first uoyage, according to the course and stretching of the land as it lyeth.
</p>
<p>First, after we had been mustered at Amsterdam, and euery man taken an oath that was
then purposely ministered vnto vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5616src" href="#xd33e5616" title="Go to note 14.">14</a> vpon the 18 of June wee sailed to the Texel, from thence to put to sea with other
ships that were appointed to meet vs at a certaine day; and so to begin our uoiage
in the name of God.
</p>
<p>The 2 of July, wee set saile out of the Texel, in the morning at breake of day, holding
our course north-west and by north, and sayled about sixe [24] miles.
</p>
<p>After that wee sailed north north-west 18 [72] miles, till the 3 of July in the morning,
being then as we esteemed <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>vnder 55 degrees; then the wind being north-west, and north north-west, calme weather,
we sailed west and west and by south 4 [16] miles, till the 4 of July in the morning:
after that, the winde being north north-west and rather more northerly, wee sayled
west and west and by north 15 [60] miles, till the 5 of July in the morning, and after
that 8 [32] miles more, till the sunne was west [¼ to 4 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>]
</p>
<p>Then we wound about and sailed 10 [40] miles north-east, till the 6 of July in the
morning, and so held on our course for the space of 24 [96] miles till the 7 July,
the sunne being south [¾ p. 10 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and held the same course for 8 [32] miles, till midnight.
</p>
<p>Then wee wound about and sailed west south-west fourteene [56] miles, till the ninth
of July in the morning; and then againe wee wound north-eastward till evening, and
so sayled about tenne [40] miles.
</p>
<p>And then eighteene [72] miles more, east-ward,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5639src" href="#xd33e5639" title="Go to note 15.">15</a> till the tenth of July in the euening; then we wound about againe and sailed south-west,

<p>The 13 of July wee wound about againe, and sailed south-west and west south-west 10

saw Norway, and then wee sayled north and by east 18 [72] miles, till the 16 of July
in the euening; at that time the sunne being north-west [½ p. <span class="asc">P.M.</span>]; and <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>vpon the 17 of July, north-east and north-east and by north, 24 [96] miles, till the
sunne was in the west [¾ p. 3 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>]
</p>
<p>Then againe wee sayled north-east,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5670src" href="#xd33e5670" title="Go to note 17.">17</a> 20 [80] miles, till the 18 of July, the sunne being north-west; from thence wee sayled
north-west and by north 18 [72] miles, till the 19 of July, when the sunne was west.
</p>
<p>From thence againe we wound about, north-east and by north and north-east, till the
20 of July, while sixe glasses were run out, in the first quarter,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5679src" href="#xd33e5679" title="Go to note 18.">18</a> and then stayed for our pinnace, that could not follow vs because the wind blew so
stiffe: that quarter<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5691src" href="#xd33e5691" title="Go to note 19.">19</a> being out, we saw our company lying to lee-ward,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5694src" href="#xd33e5694" title="Go to note 20.">20</a> to stay for vs, and when wee were gotten to them, wee helde our course (as before)
till euening and sailed about 30 [120] miles.
</p>
<p>Then we sayled south-east and by east 26 [104] miles, till the 21 of July in the euening,
when we set our watch, and held on the same course for 10 [40] miles till the 22 of
July, the sun being south south-east [9 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>]: the same euening,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5704src" href="#xd33e5704" title="Go to note 21.">21</a> the sun being south south-west [¾ p. 11 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], we saw a great whale right before our bough,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5712src" href="#xd33e5712" title="Go to note 22.">22</a> that lay and slept, which by the rushing of the ship that made towards it, and the
noyse of our men, awaked and swamme away, or els wee must haue sailed full vpon her;
and so wee sayled eight [32] miles, till the sunne was north north-west [¼ p. 9 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>].
</p>
<p>The twenty-third<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5720src" href="#xd33e5720" title="Go to note 23.">23</a> of July wee sayled south-east and by south fifteene [60] miles, till the sunne was
south south-west <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>and saw land about foure [16] miles from vs. Then wee wound of from the land, when
the sunne was about south south-west, and sayled twentie-foure [96] miles till euening,
that the sunne was north-west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5726src" href="#xd33e5726" title="Go to note 24.">24</a>

<p>After that we sayled north-ward tenne [40] miles, till the twenty-fifth<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5736src" href="#xd33e5736" title="Go to note 25.">25</a> of July at noone, and then north north-west eight [32] miles, till mid-night; then
wee wound about againe, and sayled east south-east and south-east and by south, till
the twenty sixe of July, the sunne being south, and had the sunne at seauentie one

</p>
<p>After that, wee sayled full north-east<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5750src" href="#xd33e5750" title="Go to note 28.">28</a> 16 [64] myles, till the 28 of July, the sunne being east [½ p. 4 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>]. Then we wound about againe south and by east, till the sunne was north-west, and
sayled 8 [32] miles. After that, south-east and by south 18 [72] miles, till the 29<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5760src" href="#xd33e5760" title="Go to note 29.">29</a> of July at midnight.
</p>
<p>After that, we wound about againe, east and by north, and sayled eight [32] miles,
till the 30 of July, when the sunne was north [½ p. 10 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>]; then we wound south south-east, with<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5769src" href="#xd33e5769" title="Go to note 30.">30</a> calme weather, till the 31 of July, that the sunne was west north-west<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5774src" href="#xd33e5774" title="Go to note 31.">31</a> [5 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and sayled sixe [24] miles.
</p>
<p>From thence wee sayled east-ward 8 [32] myles, till the first of August about midnight,
in calme faire weather, and saw Trumpsand<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5783src" href="#xd33e5783" title="Go to note 32.">32</a> south-east from vs, the sunne being north [½ p. 10 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and wee being tenne [40] miles from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>land; and so sayled till the sunne was east [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], with a litle cold gale<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5796src" href="#xd33e5796" title="Go to note 33.">33</a> out of the east north-east; and after that, south-east 9 miles and a halfe [38 miles],
till the sunne was north-west.
</p>
<p>Then we wound about againe, being halfe a mile [2 miles] from the land, and sayled
east and by north three [12] miles, till the 3 of August, the sunne south-west [1
<span class="asc">P.M.</span>]; and then along by the land about 5 [20] miles.
</p>
<p>Then we wound about again, because there lay a rocke or sand, that reached about a
mile and a halfe [6 miles] out from the land into the sea, whereon Isbrant, the uize-admiral,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5808src" href="#xd33e5808" title="Go to note 34.">34</a> stroke with his shippe: but the weather being faire and good, he got off againe.
When he stroke vpon it, he was a litle before vs: and when we heard him cry out, and
saw his shippe in danger, wee in all haste wound about; and the wind being north-east
and by east, and south-east, and south-east and by south,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5813src" href="#xd33e5813" title="Go to note 35.">35</a> wee sayled 5 [20] or 6 [24] myles along by the land, till the sunne was south, vpon
the 4 of August.
</p>
<p>Then we tooke the height of the sunne, and found it to be seauentie and one degrees
and ¼. At which time till noone<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5825src" href="#xd33e5825" title="Go to note 36.">36</a> wee had calme weather: and hauing the wind southerly wee sayled east and by north,
till the fifth of August, the sunne being south-east [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], the North Cape<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5833src" href="#xd33e5833" title="Go to note 37.">37</a> lying about two [8] miles east from vs; and when the sunne was north-west <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>[½ p. 7 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], the Mother and her Daughters<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5844src" href="#xd33e5844" title="Go to note 38.">38</a> lay south-ward from vs four [16] miles, and in that time we sailed about fourteene
[56] miles.
</p>
<p>Then we sailed east north-east till the 6 of August, when wee had the sunne west north-west
[5 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and then Isbrandt, the uize-admiral, came to vs with his ship, and so bating some
of our sayles,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5854src" href="#xd33e5854" title="Go to note 39.">39</a> wee sayled about 10 [40] miles.
</p>
<p>Then wee hoysed vp our sayles againe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5861src" href="#xd33e5861" title="Go to note 40.">40</a> till the sunne was north-west, and after that halde vp againe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5868src" href="#xd33e5868" title="Go to note 41.">41</a> with an east and east north-east wind, and sailed south and by west with a stiffe
gale till the 7 of August, that the sunne was south-east; then there came a ship of
Enckhuysen out of the White Sea, and then we esteemed that wee had sailed about 8
[32] miles.
</p>
<p>The sunne being south [¾ p. 10 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], the North Cape lay south-west and by south from vs about a mile and a halfe [6
miles], and the Mother and her Daughters south-west from vs about 3 [12] miles; then
hauing an east and by north wind we wound about, and held our course north and by
east, and sailed 14 [56] miles till the 8 of August, when the sunne was south-west
[1 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>]; then we wound south and by east, and so held her course till the 9 of August, that
the sunne was south; and then we saw a high point of land south-east from vs, and
another high point of land south-ward,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5879src" href="#xd33e5879" title="Go to note 42.">42</a> about 4 [16] miles from vs, as we gest,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5886src" href="#xd33e5886" title="Go to note 43.">43</a> and so we sailed about 14 [56] miles: and then againe we <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>wound north-east and by north, till the 10 of August, the sun being east [½ p. 4 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and sailed about 8 [32] miles; after that we wound south-ward againe, till the
sunne was north-west [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and sailed, as we gest, 10 [40] miles.
</p>
<p>Then wee wound about againe, when the North Cape lay west and by south from vs about
9 [36] miles, the North-kyen<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5902src" href="#xd33e5902" title="Go to note 44.">44</a> being south and by west from vs about 3 [12] miles, and sailed north north-east till
the 11 of August, in very mistie weather 10 [40] miles, till the sunne was south [¾

</p>
<p>From thence wee wound about againe, with an east north-east wind, and sailed south-east
and by south 8 [32] miles, till the sunne was south-west [1 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>] vpon the 12 of August; then the North-kyen lying south-west and by south from vs
about 8 [32] miles, we lay and draue at sea, in calme weather,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5915src" href="#xd33e5915" title="Go to note 45.">45</a> till the 13 of August, when the sunne was south south-west [¾ p. 11 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and in that time sailed about 4 [32] miles.
</p>
<p>Then we sailed south-east and by east about 4 glasses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5925src" href="#xd33e5925" title="Go to note 46.">46</a> and the Iron-hogge with her companie (being marchants)<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5928src" href="#xd33e5928" title="Go to note 47.">47</a> took their course south-ward, and wee sailed till the 14 of August (when the sunne
was south) about 18 [72] miles, and from thence for the most part held one course
till the 15 of August, the sunne being east, and there we cast out the lead and found
70 fadome deepe, and sailed 38 [152] miles till the sunne was south.
</p>
<p>The sunne being south,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5933src" href="#xd33e5933" title="Go to note 48.">48</a> and the height thereof being <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>taken, it was found to be 70 degrees and 47 minutes; then in the night time wee cast
out the lead, and found ground at 40 fadome, it being a bancke; the sunne being north-west
[½ p. 7 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], we cast out the lead againe and had ground at 64 fadome, and so wee went on east
south-east till the 16 of August, the sunne being north-east [½ p. 1 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], and there the line being out, we found no ground at 80 fadome; and after that we
sailed east and east and by south, and in that time wee cast the lead often times
out, and found ground at 60 and 70 fadome, either more or lesse, and so sailed 36
[144] miles, till the sunne was south.
</p>
<p>Then we sailed east, and so continued till the 17 of August, the sunne being east
[½ p. 4 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] and cast out our lead, and found 60 fadome deepe, clay<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5949src" href="#xd33e5949" title="Go to note 49.">49</a> ground; and then taking the height of the sunne, when it was south-west and by south,
we found it to be 69 degrees and 54 minutes, and there we saw great store of ice all
along the coast of Noua Zembla, and casting out the lead had 75 fadome soft[1] ground,
and so sayled about 24 [96] miles.
</p>
<p>After that we held diuers courses because of the ice, and sayled south-east and by
east and south south-east for the space of 18 [72] miles, till the 18 of August, when
the sunne was east, and then wee cast out the lead againe, and found 30 fadome soft<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5956src" href="#xd33e5956" title="Go to note 50.">50</a> ground, and within two houres after that 25 fadome, red sand, with small shels;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5961src" href="#xd33e5961" title="Go to note 51.">51</a> three glasses<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5966src" href="#xd33e5966" title="Go to note 52.">52</a> after that we had ground at 20 fadome, red sand with blacke shels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5969src" href="#xd33e5969" title="Go to note 53.">53</a> as before; then we saw 2 islands, which they of Enckhuysen gaue the names of Prince
Maurice and his brother,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e5974src" href="#xd33e5974" title="Go to note 54.">54</a> which lay from us south-east 3 [12] miles, <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>being low land, and then we sailed 8 [32] miles, till the sunne was south. [¾ p. 10
<span class="asc">A.M.</span>]
</p>
<p>Then we sailed east, and oftentimes casting out the lead we found 20, 19, 18, and
17 fadome deepe, good grounde <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>mixed with blacke shels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6009src" href="#xd33e6009" title="Go to note 55.">55</a> and saw the Wey-gates (the sunne being west) [¾ p. 3 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], which lay east north-east from vs about 5 [20] miles; and after that we sailed
about 8 [32] miles.
</p>
<p>Then we sailed vnder 70 degrees,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6020src" href="#xd33e6020" title="Go to note 56.">56</a> vntill we came to the Wey-gates, most part through broken ice; and when we got to
Wey-gates, we cast out our lead, and for a long time found 13 and 14 fadome, soft<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6025src" href="#xd33e6025" title="Go to note 57.">57</a> ground mixed with blacke shels;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6030src" href="#xd33e6030" title="Go to note 58.">58</a> not long after that wee cast out the lead and found 10 fadome deepe, the wind being
north, and we forced to hold stifly aloofe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6035src" href="#xd33e6035" title="Go to note 59.">59</a> in regard of the great quantity of ice, till about midnight; then we were forced
to wind north-ward, because of certaine rocks that lay on the south side of Wey-gates,
right before vs about a mile and a halfe [6 miles], hauing ten fadome deepe: then
wee changed our course, and sailed west north-west for the space of 4 glasses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6040src" href="#xd33e6040" title="Go to note 60.">60</a> after that we wound about againe east and east and by south, and so entred into Wey-gates,
and as wee went in, we cast out the lead, and found 7 fadome deepe, little more or
lesse, till the 19 of August; and then the sunne being south-east [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] we entered into the Wey-gates, in the road, the wind being north.
</p>
<p>The right chanell betweene the Image Point<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6049src" href="#xd33e6049" title="Go to note 61.">61</a> and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>Samuters land<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6056src" href="#xd33e6056" title="Go to note 62.">62</a> was full of ice, so that it was not well<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6061src" href="#xd33e6061" title="Go to note 63.">63</a> to be past through, and so we went into the road, which we called the Trayen Bay,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6066src" href="#xd33e6066" title="Go to note 64.">64</a> because we found store of trayen-oyle there: this is a good bay for the course of
the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6072src" href="#xd33e6072" title="Go to note 65.">65</a> and good almost for all windes, and we may saile so farre into it as we will at 4,
5, and 3 fadome, good anchor-ground: on the east side it is deepe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6077src" href="#xd33e6077" title="Go to note 66.">66</a> water.
</p>
<p>The 20 of August, the height of the sunne being taken with the crosse-staffe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6084src" href="#xd33e6084" title="Go to note 67.">67</a> wee found that it was eleuated aboue the horizon 69 degrees 21 minuts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6087src" href="#xd33e6087" title="Go to note 68.">68</a> when it was south-west and by south, being at the highest, or before it began to
descend.
</p>
<p>The 21 of August we went on land within the Wey-gates<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6092src" href="#xd33e6092" title="Go to note 69.">69</a> with foure and fiftie men, to see the scituation of the countrey, and being 2 [8]
miles within the land, we found many vel-werck trayen, and such like wares,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6097src" href="#xd33e6097" title="Go to note 70.">70</a> and diuers footsteps of men and deere; whereby wee perceived that some men dwelt
thereabouts, or else vsed to come thither.
</p>
<p>And to assure vs the more thereof, wee might perceiue it by the great number of images,
which we found there upon the Image or Beelthooke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6109src" href="#xd33e6109" title="Go to note 71.">71</a> (so called by us) in great aboundance, <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>whereof ten dayes after we were better informed by the Samuters<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6116src" href="#xd33e6116" title="Go to note 72.">72</a> and the Russians, when we spake with them.
</p>
<p>And when wee entered further<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6123src" href="#xd33e6123" title="Go to note 73.">73</a> into the land, wee vsed all the meanes we could, to see if we could find any houses,
or men, by whom wee might bee informed of the scituation of the sea<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6128src" href="#xd33e6128" title="Go to note 74.">74</a> there abouts; whereof afterwards wee had better intelligence by the Samuters, that
tolde vs, that there are certaine men dwelling on the Wey-gates,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6133src" href="#xd33e6133" title="Go to note 75.">75</a> and vpon Noua Zembla; but wee could neither finde men, houses, nor any other things;
so that to have better information, we went with some of our men further south-east
into the land, towards the sea-side;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6140src" href="#xd33e6140" title="Go to note 76.">76</a> and as we went, we found a path-way made with mens feete in the mosse or marsh-ground,
about halfe knee deepe, for that going so deepe wee felt hard ground vnder our feete,
which at the deepest was no higher than our shoes; and as wee went forward to the
sea coast, wee were exceeding glad, thinking that wee had seene a passage open, where
wee might get through, because we saw so little ice there: and in the euening entering
into our ship againe, wee shewed them that newes. Meanetime our maister<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6147src" href="#xd33e6147" title="Go to note 77.">77</a> had sent out a boat to see if the Tartarian Sea<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6153src" href="#xd33e6153" title="Go to note 78.">78</a> was open, but it could not get into the sea because of the ice, yet they rowed to
the Crosse-point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6156src" href="#xd33e6156" title="Go to note 79.">79</a> and there let the boate lye, and went ouer the land to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>West Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6163src" href="#xd33e6163" title="Go to note 80.">80</a> and there perceiued that the ice in the Tartarian Sea lay full vpon the Russian coastes,
and in the mouth of Wey-gates.
</p>
<p>The twentie three of August wee found a lodgie<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6174src" href="#xd33e6174" title="Go to note 81.">81</a> or boate of Pitzore,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6177src" href="#xd33e6177" title="Go to note 82.">82</a> which was sowed together with bast or ropes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6180src" href="#xd33e6180" title="Go to note 83.">83</a> that had beene north-ward to seeke for some sea-horses teeth, trayen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6191src" href="#xd33e6191" title="Go to note 84.">84</a> and geese, which they fetcht with their boat, to lade in certaine shippes that were
to come out of Russia, through Wey-gates.
</p>
<p>Which shippes they sayd (when they spake with vs), were to saile into the Tartarian
Sea, by the riuer of Oby,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6198src" href="#xd33e6198" title="Go to note 85.">85</a> to a place called Vgolita<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6205src" href="#xd33e6205" title="Go to note 86.">86</a> in Tartaria, there to stay all winter, as they vsed to doe euery yeere: and told
vs that it would yet bee nine or tenne weekes ere it began to freeze in that place,
and that when it once began to freeze, it would freeze so hard, that as then men might
goe ouer the sea into Tartaria (along vpon the ice), which they called Mermare.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6214src" href="#xd33e6214" title="Go to note 87.">87</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 24 of August in the morning betimes, we went on board of the lodgie, to haue further
information and instruction of the sea on the east side of Wey-gates, and they gaue
vs good instruction such as you haue heard.
</p>
<p>The 25 of August we went againe to the lodgie, and in friendly maner spake with them,
we for our parts offering them friendship; and then they gaue vs 8 fat geese,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6228src" href="#xd33e6228" title="Go to note 88.">88</a> that lay in the bottome of their boat: we desired that one or two of them would goe
with vs on board our ship, and they willingly went with vs to the number of seuen;
and being in our ship they wondered much at the greatnesse and furniture of our ship:
and after they had seene and looked into it in euery place,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6233src" href="#xd33e6233" title="Go to note 89.">89</a> we set fish,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6238src" href="#xd33e6238" title="Go to note 90.">90</a> butter, and cheese before them to eat, but they refused it, saying that that day
was a fasting day with them; but at last when they saw some of our pickled-herrings,
they eat them, both heads, tayles, skin, and guts;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6243src" href="#xd33e6243" title="Go to note 91.">91</a> and hauing eaten thereof, we gaue them a small ferkin of herrings, for the which
they gaue vs great thankes, knowing not what friendship they should doe vs to requite
our courtesie, and we brought them with our pinnace into the Traen-Bay.
</p>
<p>About noone wee hoysed vp our anchors with a west north-west wind; the course or stretching
of Wey-gates is east to the Cruis point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6250src" href="#xd33e6250" title="Go to note 92.">92</a> and then north-east to the Twist point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6255src" href="#xd33e6255" title="Go to note 93.">93</a> and somewhat more easterly: From thence the land of Wey-gates reacheth north north-east,
and north and by <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>east, and then north, and somewhat westerly; we sayled north-east and east-ward<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6262src" href="#xd33e6262" title="Go to note 94.">94</a> 2 [8] miles, by the Twist point, but then we were compelled to saile backe again,
because of the great store of ice, and tooke our course to our road aforesaid; and
sayling backe againe wee found a good place by the Crosse point to anchor in, that
night.
</p>
<p>The 26 of August in the morning we hoysed anchor, and put out our forke-saile,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6270src" href="#xd33e6270" title="Go to note 95.">95</a> and so sailed to our old road, there to stay for a more conuenient time.
</p>
<p>The 28, 29, and 30 of August till the 31, the winde for the most part was south-west,
and William Barents our captaine sayled to the south side of Wey-gates, and there
went on land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6277src" href="#xd33e6277" title="Go to note 96.">96</a> where wee found certaine wilde men (called Samuters),<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6282src" href="#xd33e6282" title="Go to note 97.">97</a> and yet not altogether wilde, for they being 20 in number staid and spake with our
men, being but 9 together, about a mile [4 miles] within the land, our men not thinking
to find any men there (for that we had at other times beene on land in the *Wey-gates,
and saw none); at last, it being mistie weather, they perceiued men,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6287src" href="#xd33e6287" title="Go to note 98.">98</a> fiue and fiue in a company, and we were hard by them before<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6292src" href="#xd33e6292" title="Go to note 99.">99</a> we knew it. Then our interpreter went alone towards them to speake with them; which
they perceiuing sent one towardes vs, who comming almost to our men, tooke an arrow
out of his quiuer, offering to shoote at him; wherewith our interpretor, being without
armes, was afraide, and cryed vnto him, saying (in Russian speach), shoote not, we
are friends: which the other hearing, cast his bow and arrowes to the ground, therewith
giuing him to vnderstand that he was well content to speake with our man: which done,
our man <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>called to him once againe, and sayd, we are friendes; whereunto he made answere and
sayd, then you are welcome: and saluting one the other, bended both their heades downe
towardes the ground, after the Russian manner. This done,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6298src" href="#xd33e6298" title="Go to note 100.">100</a> our interpreter questioned with him about the scituation and stretching of the sea
east-ward through the straightes of Wey-gates; whereof he gaue vs good instruction,
saying, that when they should haue past a poynt of land about 5 dayes sayling from
thence (shewing<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6303src" href="#xd33e6303" title="Go to note 101.">101</a> north-eastward), that after that, there is a great sea (shewing towardes the south-east
vpward<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6308src" href="#xd33e6308" title="Go to note 102.">102</a>); saying, that hee knew it very well, for that one had been there that was sent thither
by their king with certaine souldiers,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6313src" href="#xd33e6313" title="Go to note 103.">103</a> whereof he had been captaine.
</p>
<p>The maner of their apparell is like as we vse to paint wild men; but they are not<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6320src" href="#xd33e6320" title="Go to note 104.">104</a> wilde, for they are of reasonable iudgement. They are apparelled in hartes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6325src" href="#xd33e6325" title="Go to note 105.">105</a> skins from the head to the feete, vnlesse it be the principallest of them, which
are apparelled, whether they bee men or women, like vnto the rest, as aforesayd, vnlesse
it bee on their heads, which they couer with certaine coloured cloth lyned with furre:
the rest wear cappes of hartes or buckes skinnes, the rough side outwardes, which
stand close to their heades, and are very fitte. They weare long hayre, which they
plaite and fold and let it hang downe vpon their backes. They are (for the most part
all) short and low of stature, with broad flat faces, small eyes, short legges, their
knees standing outwards; and are very quicke to goe and leape. They trust not strangers:
for although that wee shewed them all the <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>courtesie and friendship that wee could, yet they trusted vs not much: which wee perceiued
hereby, that as vpon the first of September we went againe on land to them, and that
one of our men desired to see one of their bowes, they refused it, making a signe
that they would not doe it. Hee that they called their king, had centinels standing
abroad, to see what was done in the countrie, and what was bought and sould. At last,
one of our men went neerer to one of the centinels, to speake with him, and offered
him great friendship, according to their accustomed manner; withall giuing him a bisket,
which he with great thankes tooke, and presently eate it, and while he eate it, hee
still lookt diligently about him on all sides what was done.
</p>
<p>Their sleades<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6334src" href="#xd33e6334" title="Go to note 106.">106</a> stood alwayes ready with one or two hartes in them, that runne so swiftly with one
or two men in them, that our horses were not able to follow them. One of our men shot
a musket towards the sea, wherewith they were in so great feare that they ranne and
leapt like mad men; yet at last they satisfied themselues when they perceiued that
it was not maliciously done to hurt them: and we told them by our interpretor, that
we vsed our peeces in stead of bowes, whereat they wondered, because of the great
blow and noyse that it gaue and made: and to shew them what we could doe therewith,
one of our men tooke a flatte stone about halfe a handfull broad, and set it vpon
a hill a good way off from him: which they perceiuing, and thinking that wee meant
some-what thereby, 50 or 60 of them gathered round about vs, and yet some-what farre
off; wherewith hee that had the peece, shotte it off, and with the bullet smote the
stone in sunder, whereat they woondred much more then before.
</p>
<p>After that we tooke our leaues one of the other, with great friendship on both sides;
and when we were in our penace,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6339src" href="#xd33e6339" title="Go to note 107.">107</a> we al put off our hattes and bowed our heades vnto them, <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>sounding our trumpet: they in their maner saluting vs also, and then went to their
sleads againe.
</p>
<p>And after they were gone from vs and were some-what within the land, one of them came
ryding to the shore, to fetch a rough-heawed image, that our men had taken off the
shore and carried into their boate: and when he was in our boate, and perceiued the
image, hee made vs a signe that wee had not done well to take away that image; which
wee beholding, gaue it to him again: which when he had receiued, he placed it vpon
a hill right by the sea side, and tooke it not with him, but sent a slead to fetch
it from thence. And as farre as wee could perceiue, they esteemed that image to be
their god;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6346src" href="#xd33e6346" title="Go to note 108.">108</a> for that right ouer against that place in the Wey-gates, which we called Beelthooke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6351src" href="#xd33e6351" title="Go to note 109.">109</a> we found certaine hundreds of such carued images, all rough, about the heads being
somewhat round, and in the middle hauing a litle hill instead of a nose, and about
the nose two cuttes in place of eyes, and vnder the nose a cutte in place of a mouth.
Before the images, wee found great store of ashes, and bones of hartes; whereby it
is to be supposed that there they offered vnto them.
</p>
<p>Hauing left the Samuters, the sunne being south-ward,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6356src" href="#xd33e6356" title="Go to note 110.">110</a> William Barents, our captaine, spake to the admirall to will him to set sayle, that
they might goe forward; but they had not so many wordes together, as was betweene
them the day before;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6361src" href="#xd33e6361" title="Go to note 111.">111</a> for that when the admirall and vize-admirall had spoken with him,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6364src" href="#xd33e6364" title="Go to note 112.">112</a> the admirall seeming to be well contented therewith, said vnto him: Captaine,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6369src" href="#xd33e6369" title="Go to note 113.">113</a> what think you were best for vs to doe? he made answere, I thinke we <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>should doe well to set sayle, and goe forward on our uoyage, that wee may accomplish
it. Whereunto the admirall answeared him, and sayd: Looke well what you doe, captaine:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6376src" href="#xd33e6376" title="Go to note 114.">114</a> at which time, the sunne was north-west [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>].
</p>
<p>The 2 of September, a litle before sunne rising, wee put foorth our anckor<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6388src" href="#xd33e6388" title="Go to note 115.">115</a> to get out, for that the winde as then blew south south-west; it being good weather
to get out, and ill weather to lie still: for we lay under a low bancke.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6393src" href="#xd33e6393" title="Go to note 116.">116</a> The admirall and vize-admirall seeing vs making out, began also to hoyse their anckors,
and to set sayle.
</p>
<p>When wee put out our focke-sayle,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6400src" href="#xd33e6400" title="Go to note 117.">117</a> the sunne was east and by south [½ p. 5 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>]; and then we sayled to the Crosse-poynt, and there wee cast anckor to stay for the
vize-admirals pinnace; which with much labour and paines in time got out of the ice,
by often casting out of their anckor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6406src" href="#xd33e6406" title="Go to note 118.">118</a> and in the euening shee got to vs. In the morning, about 2 houres before sunne rising,
we set sayle, and by sunne rising we got within a mile [4 miles] east-ward of the
Twist-poynt,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6411src" href="#xd33e6411" title="Go to note 119.">119</a> and sayled north-ward 6 miles, till the sunne was south [¾ p. 10 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>]. Then wee were forced to wind about, because of the great quantitie of ice, and
the mist that then fell; at which time the winde blew so vncertaine that we could
hold no course, but were forced continually to winde and turne about,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6418src" href="#xd33e6418" title="Go to note 120.">120</a> by reason of the ice and the vnconstantnesse of the wind, together with the mist,
so that our course was vncertaine, and we supposed that we had sailed south-ward vp
towardes the Samuters countrey, and then held our course south-west, till the watchers<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6423src" href="#xd33e6423" title="Go to note 121.">121</a> were north-west from <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>vs; then we came to the point of the States Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6456src" href="#xd33e6456" title="Go to note 122.">122</a> lying east-ward about a musket shot from the land, having 13 fadome deepe.
</p>
<p>The 4 of September, we hoysed anchor because of the ice, and sailed betwene the firme
land and the States Island, where wee lay close by the States Island at 4 and 5 fadome
deepe, and made our shippe fast with a cable cast on the shoare; and there we were
safe from the course of the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6463src" href="#xd33e6463" title="Go to note 123.">123</a> and diuers time went on land to get<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6468src" href="#xd33e6468" title="Go to note 124.">124</a> hares, whereof there were many in that island.
</p>
<p>The 6 of September, some of our men went on shore vpon the firme land to seeke for
stones, which are a kinde of diamont,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6475src" href="#xd33e6475" title="Go to note 125.">125</a> whereof there are many also in the States Island: and while they were seeking y<sup>e</sup> stones, 2 of our mē lying together in one place, a great leane white beare came sodainly
stealing out, and caught one of them fast by the necke, who not knowing what it was
that tooke him by the necke, cried out and said, Who is that that pulles me so by
the necke? <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>Wherewith the other, that lay not farre from him,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6483src" href="#xd33e6483" title="Go to note 126.">126</a> lifted vp his head to see who it was, and perceiuing it to be a monsterous beare,
cryed and sayd, Oh mate, it is a beare! and therewith presently rose vp and ran away.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate01width" id="plate01"><img src="images/plate01.png" alt="How a frightful, cruel, big bear tare to pieces two of our companions." width="720" height="569"><p class="figureHead">How a frightful, cruel, big bear tare to pieces two of our companions.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The beare at the first faling vpon the man, bit his head in sunder,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6495src" href="#xd33e6495" title="Go to note 127.">127</a> and suckt out his blood, wherewith the rest of the men that were on land, being about
20 in number, ran presently thither, either to saue the man, or else to driue the
beare from the dead body; and hauing charged their peeces and bent their pikes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6500src" href="#xd33e6500" title="Go to note 128.">128</a> set vpon her, that still was deuouring the man, but perceiuing them to come towards
her, fiercely and cruelly ran at them, and gat another of them out from the companie,
which she tare in peeces, wherewith all the rest ran away.
</p>
<p>We perceiuing out of our ship and pinace that our men ran to the sea-side to save
themselues, with all speed entered into our boates, and rowed as fast as we could
to the shoare to relieue our men. Where being on land, we beheld the cruell spectacle
of our two dead men, that had beene so cruelly killed and torne in pieces by the beare.
Wee seeing that, incouraged our men to goe backe againe with vs, and with peeces,
curtleaxes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6507src" href="#xd33e6507" title="Go to note 129.">129</a> and halfe pikes, to set vpon the beare; but they would not all agree thereunto, some
of them saying, Our men are already dead, and we shall get the beare well enough,
though wee oppose not our selues into so open danger; if wee might saue our fellowes
liues, then we would make haste; but now wee neede not make such speede, but take
her at an aduantage, with most securitie for our selues, for we haue to doe with a
cruell, fierce and rauenous beast. Whereupon three of our men went forward, the beare
still <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>deuouring her prey, not once fearing the number of our men, and yet they were thirtie
at the least: the three that went forward in that sort, were Cornelius Jacobson,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6512src" href="#xd33e6512" title="Go to note 130.">130</a> maister of William Barents shippe, William Gysen, pilote of the pinace, and Hans
van Nufflen, William Barents purser:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6517src" href="#xd33e6517" title="Go to note 131.">131</a> and after that the sayd maister and pilote had shot three times and mist, the purser
stepping somewhat further forward, and seeing the beare to be within the length of
a shot, presently leauelled his peece, and discharging it at the beare, shot her into
the head betweene both the eyes, and yet shee held the man still faste by the necke,
and lifted vp her head, with the man in her mouth, but shee beganne somewhat to stagger;
wherewith the purser and a Scotishman<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6524src" href="#xd33e6524" title="Go to note 132.">132</a> drew out their courtlaxes, and stroke at her so hard that their courtlaxes burst,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6530src" href="#xd33e6530" title="Go to note 133.">133</a> and yet she would not leaue the man. At last William Geysen went to them, and with
all his might stroke the beare vpon the snowt with his peece, at which time the beare
fell to the ground, making a great noyse, and William Geyson leaping vpon her cut
her throat. The seuenth of September wee buryed the dead bodyes of our men in the
States Island, and hauing fleaed the beare, carryed her skinne to Amsterdam.
</p>
<p>The ninth of September, wee set saile from the States Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6537src" href="#xd33e6537" title="Go to note 134.">134</a> but the ice came in so thicke and with such force, that wee could not get through;
so that at euening wee came backe againe to the States Island, the winde being <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>westerly. There the admirale and the pinace of Roterdam fell on ground by certaine
rockes, but gote off againe without any hurt.
</p>
<p>The tenth of September wee sayled againe from the States Island towards the Wey-gates,
and sent two boates into the sea to certifie vs what store of ice was abroad; and
that euening we came all together into Wey-gates, and anckored by the Twist Point.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6546src" href="#xd33e6546" title="Go to note 135.">135</a>
</p>
<p>The 11 of September in the morning, we sailed againe into the Tartarian Sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6551src" href="#xd33e6551" title="Go to note 136.">136</a> but we fell into great store of ice, so that wee sailed back againe to the Wey-gates,
and anckored by the Crosse Point, and about mid-night we saw a Russian lodgie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6554src" href="#xd33e6554" title="Go to note 137.">137</a> that sailed from the Beeltpoint<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6557src" href="#xd33e6557" title="Go to note 138.">138</a> towardes the Samuters land. The 13 of September, the sunne being south [¾ p. 10 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], there beganne a great storme to blow out of the south south-west,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6563src" href="#xd33e6563" title="Go to note 139.">139</a> the weather being mistie, melancholly,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6571src" href="#xd33e6571" title="Go to note 140.">140</a> and snowie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6576src" href="#xd33e6576" title="Go to note 141.">141</a> and the storme increasing more and more, we draue through.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6581src" href="#xd33e6581" title="Go to note 142.">142</a>
</p>
<p>The 14 of September the weather beganne to bee somewhat clearer, the winde being north-west,
and the storme blowing stiffe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6588src" href="#xd33e6588" title="Go to note 143.">143</a> out of the Tartarian Sea; but at euening it was<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6595src" href="#xd33e6595" title="Go to note 144.">144</a> faire weather, and then the wind blewe north-east. The same day our men went on the
other side of Wey-gates on the firme land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6600src" href="#xd33e6600" title="Go to note 145.">145</a> to take the depth of the channel, and entered into the bough behinde the islands,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6605src" href="#xd33e6605" title="Go to note 146.">146</a> where there stood a <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>little howse made of wood, and a great fall of water into the land.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6613src" href="#xd33e6613" title="Go to note 147.">147</a> The same morning we hoysed vp our anckor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6618src" href="#xd33e6618" title="Go to note 148.">148</a> thinking once againe to try what we could doe to further our uoyage; but our admirall
being of another minde, lay still till the fifteene of September.
</p>
<p>The same day in the morning the winde draue in from the east end of the Wey-gates,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6625src" href="#xd33e6625" title="Go to note 149.">149</a> whereby wee were forced presently to hoyse anchors, and the same day sailed out from
the west ende of the Wey-gates, with all our fleete, and made home-wardes againe,
and that day past by the islands called Matfloe and Delgoy,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6632src" href="#xd33e6632" title="Go to note 150.">150</a> and that night wee sayled twelue [48] miles, north-west and by west, till Saterday
in the morning, and then the winde fell north-east, and it began to snow.
</p>
<p>The 16 of September, from morning to evening, wee sayled west north-west 18 [72] miles,
at 42 fadome deepe; in the night it snowed, and there blew very much winde out of

<p>After that wee sailed all the night againe till the 17 of September in the morning,

<p>Sunday in the morning wee had the winde north and north-west, with a great gale, and
then the admirals pinnace kept vs company, and sailed by vs with one saile from morning

miles.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then we saw the point of Candynaes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6656src" href="#xd33e6656" title="Go to note 154.">154</a> lying south-east from vs, and then wee had 27 fadome deepe, redde sand with blacke

east-ward from Kildwin;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6722src" href="#xd33e6722" title="Go to note 166.">166</a> and then we wound off from the land, and so held off for 3 houres together; after
that we wound towards the land againe, and thought to goe into <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>Kilduin, but we were too low;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6729src" href="#xd33e6729" title="Go to note 167.">167</a> so that after-noone we wound off from the land againe, and till euening sailed east

voyages. He was afterwards employed in the navy of Holland, and served his country
with great honour. In 1607, having the rank of vice-admiral, he commanded a fleet
of twenty-six vessels sent against the Spaniards, and on the 25th of April fell in
with the Spanish fleet, consisting of twenty ships and ten galleons, commanded by
Don Juan Alvarez Davila. The engagement took place before Gibraltar; and on the second
broadside Heemskerck had a leg carried away by a cannon-shot. He, however, continued
to encourage his men, and retained his sword till he died. The Dutch gained a complete
victory; seven vessels of the Spaniards were burned, and most of the remainder sunk;
their admiral being killed, and his son taken prisoner. A superb monument was erected

Nai on the first voyage. But, according to Linschoten, <i>Voyagie, ofte Schipvaert <span class="pageNum" id="pb51n">[<a href="#pb51n">51</a>]</span>van by Noorden om, etc.</i>, fol. 19, retr., Orange Island was so called in honour of Prince Maurice’s <i>father</i> and the Princess of Orange.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Lütke (p. 32) identifies Maurice Island with Ostrov Dolgoi or Long Island, and Orange
Island with Bolschoi Selénets or Great Greenland; and he is of opinion that the Hollanders,
or at all events Linschoten, had no knowledge of Matvyéyev Island. But this is hardly
consistent with that able navigator’s previous identification of the latter island
with Matfloe, where (as is mentioned in page 36 of the present work) the vessels of
Nai and Barentsz met on the first voyage. And, indeed, it may be demonstrated that
Maurice Island is not Dolgoi, but Matfloe or Matvyéyev Island; that Orange Island
is the small island, named Ostrov Golets, close to the northern extremity of Long
Island or Dolgoi; and that Dolgoi itself is the Land of New Walcheren, which the Dutch
hesitated to describe as an island or as a portion of the mainland, but which Lütke
(p. 32) erroneously deems to be the latter.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Premising that Linschoten’s vessel, like that of Barentsz, passed between Matfloe
and Dolgoi, the following description of the <i>three</i> islands above mentioned, given by Linschoten, will be found to be as conclusive as
it is clear and intelligible. In fol. 18, that writer says:—“The island that lay to
the north of us appeared to be of a roundish form, and on the side past which we sailed
it was to the sight a short mile [3 or 4 miles] in extent. To the south of this island,
and about a long mile [4 or 5 miles] distant, lay another island, which was the smallest
and likewise the middlemost of the three. And from this middlemost island, about a
short mile [3 or 4 miles] distant to the S.E., lay the third or southernmost island,
which in appearance was much the largest, and which, as we sailed past it, lay on
our left hand, and seemed on that side to be about a long mile [4 or 5 miles] in extent;
but when on the other side, as we looked southwards at it, its west coast extended
as far as we could see from the topmast, so that we doubted whether it was part of
the continent or an island.” And in the chart which accompanies these remarks, Linschoten
has the following note:—“Maurice Island lies with the Land of New Walcheren N.N.W.
and S.S.E., about 2 [8] miles apart; and with the Island of Orange it lies N. and
S., a long mile [4 or 5 miles] distant.”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">On referring to Lütke’s chart, it will at once be manifest how closely Maurice Island,
New Walcheren, and Orange Island, as thus described, correspond with Matvyéyev Island
or Matfloe, Long Island or Dolgoi, <span class="pageNum" id="pb52n">[<a href="#pb52n">52</a>]</span>and Golets Island, respectively; and if to this be added, that in that chart the passage
between the islands is in about 69° 30′ N. lat., and that Linschoten, when distant
from Maurice Island, by estimation, 10 [40] miles W. by N. or nearly W., found himself
to be in 69° 34′ N. <span class="corr" id="xd33e5995" title="Source: at.">lat.</span>, while William Barentsz, when 2 [8] miles W. from the islands, made his latitude
to be 69° 15′ N., there will remain no room for doubt on the subject.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e5974src" title="Return to note 54 in text.">↑</a></p>

<h2 class="main xd33e4068">THE THIRD VOYAGE NORTH-WARD<br>
TO THE KINGDOMES OF CATHAIA<br>
and China, in Anno 1596.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After that the seuen shippes (as I saide before) were returned backe againe from their
north uoiage, with lesse benefit than was expected, the Generall States of the United
Prouinces consulted together to send certaine ships thither againe a third time,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6766src" href="#xd33e6766" title="Go to note 1.">1</a> to see if they might bring the sayd uoyage to a good end, if it were possible to
be done: but after much consultation had, they could not agree thereon; yet they were
content to cause a proclamation to be made,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6771src" href="#xd33e6771" title="Go to note 2.">2</a> that if any, either townes or marchants, were disposed to venture to make further
search that way at their owne charges, if the uoyage were accomplished, and that thereby
it might bee made apparent that the sayd passage was to be sayled, they were content
to give them a good reward in the countryes behalfe, naming a certaine summe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6774src" href="#xd33e6774" title="Go to note 3.">3</a> of money. Whereupon in the beginning of this yeare, there was two shippes rigged
and set foorth by the towne of Amsterdam, to sayle that uoyage, the men therein being
taken vp vpon two conditions: viz., what they should have if the uoyage were not accomplished,
and what they should have if they got through and brought the uoiage to an end, promising
them a good reward if they could effect it, thereby to incourage the men, taking vp
as many vnmarryed men as they could, that they might not bee disswaded by means of
their wiues and children, to leaue off the uoyage. Upon these <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>conditions, those two shippes were ready to set saile in the beginning of May. In
the one, Jacob Heemskerke Hendrickson was master and factor for the wares and marchandise,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6781src" href="#xd33e6781" title="Go to note 4.">4</a> and William Barents chiefe pilote. In the other, John Cornelison Rijp<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6787src" href="#xd33e6787" title="Go to note 5.">5</a> was both master and factor for the goods that the marchants had laden in her.
</p>
<p>The 5 of May all the men in both the shippes were mustered, and vpon the tenth of
May they sayled from Amsterdam, and the 13 of May got to the Vlie.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6793src" href="#xd33e6793" title="Go to note 6.">6</a> The sixteenth wee set saile out of the Vlie, but the tyde being all most spent<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6796src" href="#xd33e6796" title="Go to note 7.">7</a> and the winde north-east, we were compelled to put in againe; at which time John
Cornelisons ship fell on ground,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6801src" href="#xd33e6801" title="Go to note 8.">8</a> but got off againe, and wee anchored at the east ende of the Vlie.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6806src" href="#xd33e6806" title="Go to note 9.">9</a> The 18 of May wee put out of the Vlie againe with a north-east winde, and sayled
north north-west. The 22 of May wee saw the islands of Hitland<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6811src" href="#xd33e6811" title="Go to note 10.">10</a> and Feyerilland, the winde beeing north-east. The 24 of May wee had a good winde,
and sayled north-east till the 29th of May; then the winde was against vs, and blewe
north-east in our top-sayle.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6817src" href="#xd33e6817" title="Go to note 11.">11</a> The 30 of May we had a good winde,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6822src" href="#xd33e6822" title="Go to note 12.">12</a> and sailed north-east, and we tooke the height of the sunne with our crosse-staffe,
and found that it was eleuated aboue the horizon 47 degrees and 42 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6827src" href="#xd33e6827" title="Go to note 13.">13</a> his declination was <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>21 degrees and 42 minutes, so that the height of the Pole was 69 degrees and twentie-foure
minutes.
</p>
<p>The first of June wee had no night, and the second of June wee had the winde contrary;
but vpon the fourth of June wee had a good winde out of the west north-west, and sayled
north-east.
</p>
<p>And when the sunne was about south south-east [½ p. 9 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], wee saw a strange sight in the element:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6838src" href="#xd33e6838" title="Go to note 14.">14</a> for on each side of the sunne there was another sunne, and two raine-bowes that past
cleane through the three sunnes, and then two raine-bowes more, the one compassing
round about the sunnes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6843src" href="#xd33e6843" title="Go to note 15.">15</a> and the other crosse through the great rundle;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6848src" href="#xd33e6848" title="Go to note 16.">16</a> the great rundle standing with the vttermost point<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6853src" href="#xd33e6853" title="Go to note 17.">17</a> eleuated aboue the horizon 28 degrees. At noone, the sunne being at the highest,
the height thereof was measured, and wee found by the astrolabium that it was eleuated
aboue the horizon 48 degrees and 43 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6859src" href="#xd33e6859" title="Go to note 18.">18</a> his declination was 22 degrees and 17 minutes, the which beeing added to 48 degrees
43 minutes, it was found that wee were vnder 71 degrees of the height of the Pole.
</p>
<p>John Cornelis shippe held aloofe from vs and would not keepe with vs, but wee made
towards him, and sayled north-east, bating a point of our compasse,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6864src" href="#xd33e6864" title="Go to note 19.">19</a> for wee thought that wee were too farre west-ward, as after it appeared, otherwise
wee should haue held our course north-east. And in the euening when wee were together,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6869src" href="#xd33e6869" title="Go to note 20.">20</a> wee tolde him that wee <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>were best to keepe more easterly, because we were too farre west-ward; but his pilote
made answere that they desired not to goe into the Straights of Weygates. There course
was north-east and by north, and wee were about 60 [240] miles to sea-warde in from
the land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6876src" href="#xd33e6876" title="Go to note 21.">21</a> and were to sayle north-east<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6881src" href="#xd33e6881" title="Go to note 22.">22</a> when wee had the North Cape in sight, and therefore wee should rather haue sailed
east north-east and not north north-east, because wee were so farre west-ward, to
put our selues in our right course againe: and there wee tolde them that wee should
rather haue sayled east-ward, at the least for certaine miles, vntill wee had gotten
into our right course againe, which by meanes of the contrary winde wee had lost,
as also because it was north-east; but whatsoeuer wee sayde and sought to councell
them for the best, they would holde no course but north north-east, for they alleaged
that if wee went any more easterly that then wee should enter into the Wey-gates;
but wee being not able [with many hard words]<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6887src" href="#xd33e6887" title="Go to note 23.">23</a> to perswade them, altered our course one point of the compasse, to meete them, and
sayled north-east and by north, and should otherwise haue sayled north-east and somewhat<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6891src" href="#xd33e6891" title="Go to note 24.">24</a> more east.
</p>
<p>The fifth of June wee sawe the first ice, which wee wondered at, at the first thinking
that it had been white swannes, for one of our men walking in the fore-decke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6898src" href="#xd33e6898" title="Go to note 25.">25</a> on a suddaine beganne to cry out with a loud voyce, and sayd that hee sawe white
swans: which wee that were vnder hatches<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6903src" href="#xd33e6903" title="Go to note 26.">26</a> hearing, presently came vp, and perceiued that it was ice that came driuing from
the great heape,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6908src" href="#xd33e6908" title="Go to note 27.">27</a> showing like swannes, <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>it being then about euening: at mid-night wee sailed through it, and the sunne was
about a degree eleuated aboue the horizon in the north.
</p>
<p>The sixth of June, about foure of the clocke in the after-noone, wee entred againe
into the ice, which was so strong that wee could not passe through it, and sayled
south-west and by west, till eight glasses were runne out;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6917src" href="#xd33e6917" title="Go to note 28.">28</a> after that wee kept on our course north north-east, and sayled along by the ice.
</p>
<p>The seuenth of June wee tooke the height of the sunne, and found that it was eleuated
aboue the horizon thirtie eight degrees and thirtie eight minutes, his declination
beeing twentie two degrees thirtie eight minutes; which beeing taken from thirtie
eight degrees thirty eight minutes, wee found the Pole to bee seuentie foure degrees:
there wee found so great a store of ice, that it was admirable: and wee sayled along
through it, as if wee had past betweene two lands, the water being as greene as grasse;
and wee supposed that we were not farre from Greene-land, and the longer wee sayled
the more and thicker ice we found.
</p>
<p>The eight of June wee came to so great a heape of ice, that wee could not saile through
it, because it was so thicke, and therefore wee wound about south-west and by west
till two glasses were runne out,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6923src" href="#xd33e6923" title="Go to note 29.">29</a> and after that three glasses<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6926src" href="#xd33e6926" title="Go to note 30.">30</a> more south south-west, and then south three glasses, to sayle to the island that
wee saw, as also to shunne the ice.
</p>
<p>The ninth of June wee found the islande, that lay vnder 74 degrees and 30 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6931src" href="#xd33e6931" title="Go to note 31.">31</a> and (as wee gest) it was about fiue [20] miles long.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6934src" href="#xd33e6934" title="Go to note 32.">32</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>The tenth of June wee put out our boate, and therewith eight of our men went on land;
and as wee past by John Cornelisons shippe, eight of his men also came into our boate,
whereof one was the pilote. Then William Barents [our pilot] asked him whether wee
were not too much west-ward, but hee would not acknowledge it: whereupon there passed
many wordes betweene them, for William Barents sayde hee would prooue it to bee so,
as in trueth it was.
</p>
<p>The eleuenth of June, going on land, wee found great store of sea-mewes egges vpon
the shoare, and in that island wee were in great danger of our liues: for that going
vp a great hill of snowe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6944src" href="#xd33e6944" title="Go to note 33.">33</a> when we should come down againe, wee thought wee should all haue broken our neckes,
it was so slipperie<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6956src" href="#xd33e6956" title="Go to note 34.">34</a> but we sate vpon the snowe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6961src" href="#xd33e6961" title="Go to note 35.">35</a> and slidde downe, which was very dangerous for vs to breake both our armes and legges,
for that at the foote of the hill there was many rockes, which wee were likely to
haue fallen vpon, yet by Gods help wee got safely downe againe.
</p>
<p>Meane time William Barents sate in the boate, and sawe vs slide downe, and was in
greater feare then wee to behold vs in that danger. In the sayd island we found the
varying of our compasse, which was 13 degrees, so that it differed a whole point at
the least; after that wee rowed aboard John Cornelisons shippe, and there wee eate
our eggs.
</p>
<p>The 12 of June in the morning, wee saw a white beare, which wee rowed after with our
boate, thinking to cast a roape about her necke; but when we were neere her, shee
<span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>was so great<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6970src" href="#xd33e6970" title="Go to note 36.">36</a> that we durst not doe it, but rowed backe again to our shippe to fetch more men and
our armes, and so made to her againe with muskets, hargubushes, halbertes, and hatchets,
John Cornellysons men comming also with their boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6975src" href="#xd33e6975" title="Go to note 37.">37</a> to helpe vs. And so beeing well furnished of men and weapons, wee rowed with both
our boates vnto the beare, and fought with her while foure glasses were runne out,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6980src" href="#xd33e6980" title="Go to note 38.">38</a> for our weapons could doe her litle hurt; and amongst the rest of the blowes that
wee gaue her, one of our men stroke her into the backe with an axe, which stucke fast
in her backe, and yet she swomme away with it; but wee rowed after her, and at last
wee cut her head in sunder with an axe, wherewith she dyed; and then we brought her
into John Cornelysons shippe, where wee fleaed her, and found her skinne to bee twelue
foote long: which done, wee eate some of her flesh; but wee brookt it not well.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6983src" href="#xd33e6983" title="Go to note 39.">39</a> This island wee called the Beare Island.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e6989src" href="#xd33e6989" title="Go to note 40.">40</a>
</p>
<p>The 13 of June we left the island, and sayled north and somewhat easterly, the winde
being west and south-west, and made good way; so that when the sunne was north [¼
p. 11 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], we gest that wee had sayled 16 [64] miles north-ward from that island.
</p>
<p>The 14 of June, when the sunne was north, wee cast out our lead 113 fadome deepe,
but found no ground, and so sayled forward till the 15 of June, when the sunne was
south-east [½ p. 8 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], with mistie and drisling<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7006src" href="#xd33e7006" title="Go to note 41.">41</a> weather, and sayled north and north and by east; about euening it <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>cleared up, and then wee saw a great thing driuing<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7013src" href="#xd33e7013" title="Go to note 42.">42</a> in the sea, which we thought had been a shippe, but passing along by it wee perceiued
it to be a dead whale, that stouncke monsterously; and on it there sate a great number
of sea meawes. At that time we had sayled 20 [80] miles.
</p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 16 of June, with the like speed wee sayled north and by east, with mistie weather;
and as wee sayled, wee heard the ice before wee saw it; but after, when it cleared
vp, wee saw it, and then wound off from it, when as wee guest wee had sayled 30 [120]
miles.
</p>
<p>The 17 and 18 of June, wee saw great store of ice, and sayled along by it vntill wee
came to the poynt, which wee could not reach,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7023src" href="#xd33e7023" title="Go to note 43.">43</a> for that the winde was south-east, which was right against vs, and the point of ice
lay south-ward from vs: yet we laueared<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7028src" href="#xd33e7028" title="Go to note 44.">44</a> a great while to get beyond it, but we could not do it.
</p>
<p>The 19 of June we saw land againe. Then wee tooke the height of the sunne, and found
that it was eleuated aboue the horizon 33 degrees and 37 minutes, her declination
being 23 degrees and 26 minutes; which taken from the sayd 33 degrees and 37 minutes,
we found that we were vnder 80 degrees and 11 minutes, which was the height of the
Pole there.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7033src" href="#xd33e7033" title="Go to note 45.">45</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>This land was very great,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7080src" href="#xd33e7080" title="Go to note 46.">46</a> and we sayled west-ward along by it till wee were vnder 79 degrees and a halfe, where
we found a good road, and could not get neere to the land because the winde blew north-east,
which was right off from the land: the bay reacht right north and south into the sea.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 21 of June we cast out our anchor at 18 fadome before the land; and then wee and
John Cornelysons men rode on the west side of the land, and there fetcht balast: and
when wee got on board againe with our balast, wee saw a white beare that swamme towardes
our shippe; wherevpon we left off our worke, and entering into the boate with John
Cornelisons men, rowed after her, and crossing her in the way, droue her from the
land; where-with shee swamme further into the sea, and wee followed her; and for that
our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7090src" href="#xd33e7090" title="Go to note 47.">47</a> could not make way after her, we manned out our scute<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7099src" href="#xd33e7099" title="Go to note 48.">48</a> also, the better to follow her: but she swamme a mile [4 miles] into the sea; yet
wee followed her with the most part of all our men of both shippes in three boates,
and stroke often times at her, cutting and heawing her, so that all our armes were
most broken in peeces. During our fight with her, shee stroke her clowes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7104src" href="#xd33e7104" title="Go to note 49.">49</a> so hard in our boate, that the signes thereof were seene in it; but as hap was, it
was in the forehead of our boate:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7107src" href="#xd33e7107" title="Go to note 50.">50</a> for if it had been in the middle thereof, she had (peraduenture) ouer-throwne it,
they haue such force in their clawes. At last, after we had fought long with her,
and made her wearie with our three boates that kept about her, we ouercame her and
killed <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>her: which done, we brought her into our shippe and fleaed her, her skinne being 13
foote long.
</p>
<p>After that, we rowed with our scute about a mile [4 miles] inward to the land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7116src" href="#xd33e7116" title="Go to note 51.">51</a> where there was a good hauen and good anchor ground, on the east-side being sandie:
there wee cast out our leade, and found 16 fadome deepe, and after that 10 and 12
fadom; and rowing further, we found that on the east-side there was two islands that
reached east-ward into the sea: on the west-side also there was a great creeke or
riuer, which shewed also like an island. Then we rowed to the island that lay in the
middle, and there we found many red geese-egges,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7121src" href="#xd33e7121" title="Go to note 52.">52</a> which we saw sitting vpon their nests, and draue them from them, and they flying
away cryed red, red, red:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7126src" href="#xd33e7126" title="Go to note 53.">53</a> and as they sate we killed one goose dead with a stone, which we drest and eate,
and at least 60 egges, that we tooke with vs aboard the shippe; and vpon the 22 of
June wee went aboard our shippe againe.
</p>
<p>Those geese were of a perfit red coulor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7141src" href="#xd33e7141" title="Go to note 54.">54</a> such as come into Holland about Weiringen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7152src" href="#xd33e7152" title="Go to note 55.">55</a> and euery yeere are there taken <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span><span class="marginnote">Red geese breed their yong geese under 80 degrees in Green-land.</span> in abundance, but till this time it was neuer knowne where they [laid and] hatcht
their egges; so that some men haue taken vpon them to write that they sit vpon trees<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7161src" href="#xd33e7161" title="Go to note 56.">56</a> in Scotland, that hang ouer the water, and such egges as fall from them downe into
the water<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7166src" href="#xd33e7166" title="Go to note 57.">57</a> become yong geese and swimme there out of the water;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7172src" href="#xd33e7172" title="Go to note 58.">58</a> but those that fall vpon the land burst in sunnder and are lost:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7177src" href="#xd33e7177" title="Go to note 59.">59</a> but this is now found to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>contrary, and it is not to bee wondered at that no man could tell where they breed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7226src" href="#xd33e7226" title="Go to note 60.">60</a> their egges, for that no man that euer we knew had euer beene vnder 80 degrees, nor
that land vnder 80 degrees was neuer set downe in any card,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7231src" href="#xd33e7231" title="Go to note 61.">61</a> much lesse the red geese that breed therein.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is here also to be noted, that although that in this land, which we esteeme to
be Greene-land, lying vnder 80 degrees <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>and more, there groweth leaues and grasse, and that there are such beasts therein
as eat grasse, as harts, buckes, and such like beastes as liue thereon; yet in Noua
Zembla, under 76 degrees, there groweth neither leaues nor grasse, nor any beasts
that eate grasse or leaues liue therein,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7241src" href="#xd33e7241" title="Go to note 62.">62</a> but such beastes as eate flesh, as beares and foxes: and yet this land lyeth full
4 degrees [further] from the North Pole as Greeneland aforesaid doth.
</p>
<p>The 23 of June we hoysted anchor againe, and sayled north-west-ward into the sea,
but could get no further by reason of the ice; and so wee came to the same place againe
where wee had laine, and cast anchor at 18 fadome: and at euening<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7248src" href="#xd33e7248" title="Go to note 63.">63</a> being at anchor, the sunne being north-east and somewhat more east-warde, wee tooke
the height thereof, and found it to be eleuated above the horizon 13 degrees and 10
minutes, his declination being 23 degrees and 28 minutes; which substracted from the
height aforesaid,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7253src" href="#xd33e7253" title="Go to note 64.">64</a> resteth 10 degrees and 18 minutes, which being substracted from 90 degrees, then
the height of the Pole, there was 79 degrees and 42 minutes.
</p>
<p>After that, we hoysted anchor againe, and sayled along by the west side of the land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7262src" href="#xd33e7262" title="Go to note 65.">65</a> and then our men went on land, to see how much the needle of the compasse varyed.
Mean time, there came a greate white beare swimming towardes the shippe, and would
haue climbed up into it if we had not made a noyse, and with that we shot at her with
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>a peece, but she left the shippe and swam to the land, where our men were: which wee
perceiuing, sayled with our shippe towardes the land, and gaue a great shoute; wherewith
our men thought that wee had fallen on a rocke with our shippe, which made them much
abashed; and therewith the beare also being afraide, swam off againe from the land
and left our men, which made vs gladde: for our men had no weapons about them.
</p>
<p>Touching the varying of the compasse, for the which cause our men went on land to
try the certaintie thereof, it was found to differ 16 degrees.
</p>
<p>The 24 of June we had a south-west winde, and could not get aboue the island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7274src" href="#xd33e7274" title="Go to note 66.">66</a> and therefore wee sayled backe againe, and found a hauen that lay foure [16] miles
from the other hauen, on the west side of the great hauen, and there cast anchor at
twelue fadome deepe. There wee rowed a great way in, and went on land; and there wee
founde two sea-horses teeth that waighed sixe pound: wee also found many small teeth,
and so rowed on board againe.
</p>
<p>The 25 of June we hoysted anchor againe, and sayled along by the land, and went south
and south south-west, with a north north-east winde, vnder 79 degrees. There we found
a great creeke or riuer,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7281src" href="#xd33e7281" title="Go to note 67.">67</a> whereinto we sailed ten [40] miles at the least, holding our course south-ward; but
we perceiued that there wee could not get through: there wee cast out our leade, and
for the most part found ten fadome deepe, but wee were constrained to lauere<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7286src" href="#xd33e7286" title="Go to note 68.">68</a> out againe, for the winde was northerly, and almost full north;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7291src" href="#xd33e7291" title="Go to note 69.">69</a> and wee perceaued that it reached to the firm land, which we supposed to be low-land,
for that wee could not see it any thing farre, and therefore wee sailed so neere vnto
it till that wee might see <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>it, and then we were forced to lauere [back], and vpon the 27 of June we got out againe.
</p>
<p>The twenty eight of June wee gate beyonde the point that lay on the west-side, where
there was so great a number of birds that they flew against our sailes, and we sailed
10 [40] miles south-ward, and after that west, to shun the ice.
</p>
<p>The twenty nine of June wee sayled south-east, and somewhat more easterly, along by
the land, till wee were vnder 76 degrees and 50 minutes, for wee were forced to put
off from the land, because of the ice.
</p>
<p>The thirteeth of June we sayled south and somewhat east, and then we tooke the height
of the sun, and found that it was eleuated aboue the horizon 38 degrees and 20 minutes,
his declination was 23 degrees and 20 minutes, which being taken from the former height,
it was found that wee were vnder 75 degrees.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7305src" href="#xd33e7305" title="Go to note 70.">70</a>
</p>
<p>The first of July wee saw the Beare-Island<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7310src" href="#xd33e7310" title="Go to note 71.">71</a> againe, and then John Cornelison and his officers came aboard of our ship, to speak
with vs about altering of our course; but wee being of a contrary opinion, it was
agreed that wee should follow on our course and hee his: which was, that hee (according
to his desire) should saile vnto 80 degrees againe; for hee was of opinion that there
hee should finde a passage through, on the east-side of the land that lay vnder 80
degrees.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7313src" href="#xd33e7313" title="Go to note 72.">72</a> And vpon that agreement wee left each other, they sayling north-ward, and wee south-ward
because of the ice, the winde being east south-east.
</p>
<p>The second of July wee sailed east-ward, and were vnder 74 degrees, hauing the wind
north north-west, and then wee wound ouer another bough<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7318src" href="#xd33e7318" title="Go to note 73.">73</a> with an east north-east winde, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>sayled north-ward. In the euening, the sunne beeing about north-west and by north
[9 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], wee wound about againe (because of the ice) with an east winde, and sailed south
south-east; and about east south-east sun<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7328src" href="#xd33e7328" title="Go to note 74.">74</a> [¼ p. 7 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] we wound about againe (because of the ice), and the sunne being south south-west
[½ p. 12 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>] we wound about againe, and sailed north-east.
</p>
<p>The third of July wee were vnder 74 degrees, hauing a south-east and by east wind,
and sailed north-east and by north: after that we wound about againe with a south
wind and sayled east south-east till the sunne was north-west [¼ p. 8 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], then the wind began to be somewhat larger.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7343src" href="#xd33e7343" title="Go to note 75.">75</a>
</p>
<p>The fourth of July wee sailed east and by north, and found no ice, which wee wondered
at, because wee sailed so high;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7350src" href="#xd33e7350" title="Go to note 76.">76</a> but when the sunne was almost south, we were forced to winde about againe by reason
of the ice, and sailed westward with a north-wind; after that, the sunne being north
[11 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], wee sailed east south-east with a north-east wind.
</p>
<p>The fifth of July wee sailed north north-east till the sunne was south [11 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>]: then wee wound about, and went east south-east with a north-east winde. Then wee
tooke the height of the sunne, and found it to bee eleuated aboue the horizon 39 degrees
and 27 minutes, his declination being 22 degrees and 53 minutes, which taken from
the high aforesaid, we found that wee were under the height of the Poole seuentie
three degrees and 20 minutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7361src" href="#xd33e7361" title="Go to note 77.">77</a>
</p>
<p>The seuenth of July wee cast out our whole lead-lyne, but found no ground, and sailed
east and by south, the wind being <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>north-east and by east, and were vnder 72 degrees and 12 minutes.
</p>
<p>The eight of July we had a good north [by] west wind, and sailed east and by north,
with an indifferent cold gale of wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7372src" href="#xd33e7372" title="Go to note 78.">78</a> and got vnder 72 degrees and 15 minutes. The ninth of July we went east and by north,
the wind being west. The tenth of July, the sunne being south south-west [9 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], we cast out our lead and had ground at 160 fadome, the winde being north-east and
by north, and we sailed east and by south vnder 72 degrees.
</p>
<p>The 11 of July we found 70 fadome deepe, and saw no ice; then we gest that we were
right south and north from Dandinaes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7382src" href="#xd33e7382" title="Go to note 79.">79</a> that is the east point of the White-Sea, that lay southward from vs, and had sandy
ground, and the bancke stretched north-ward into the sea, so that wee were out of
doubt that we were vpon the bancke of the White Sea, for wee had found no sandy ground
all the coast along, but onely that bancke. Then the winde being east and by south,
we sayled south and south and by east, vnder 72 degrees, and after that we had a south
south-east winde, and sayled north-east to get ouer the bancke.
</p>
<p>In the morning wee draue forward with a calme,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7389src" href="#xd33e7389" title="Go to note 80.">80</a> and found that we were vnder 72 degrees, and then againe wee had an east south-east
winde, the sunne being about south-west [2 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], and sayled north-east; and casting out our lead found 150 fadome deepe, clay ground,
and then we were ouer the bancke, which was very narrow, for wee sailed but 14 glasses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7397src" href="#xd33e7397" title="Go to note 81.">81</a> and gate ouer it when the sunne was about north north-east [¼ p. 12 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>].
</p>
<p>The twelfth of July wee sayled north and by east, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>winde being east; and at euening,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7408src" href="#xd33e7408" title="Go to note 82.">82</a> the sunne being north north-east, we wound about againe, hauing the winde north north-east,
and sayled east and by south till our first quarter<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7413src" href="#xd33e7413" title="Go to note 83.">83</a> was out.
</p>
<p>The thirteenth of July wee sayled east, with a north north-east wind: then we tooke
the height of the sunne and found it to bee eleuated aboue the horizon 54 degrees
and 38 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7418src" href="#xd33e7418" title="Go to note 84.">84</a> his declination was 21 degrees and 54 minutes, which taken from the height aforesaid,
the height of the Pole was found to be 73 degrees; and then againe wee found ice,
but not very much, and wee were of opinion that wee were by Willoughbies-land.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7423src" href="#xd33e7423" title="Go to note 85.">85</a>
</p>
<p>The fourteenth of July wee sailed north-east, the winde being north north-west, and
in that sort sayled about a dinner time<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7432src" href="#xd33e7432" title="Go to note 86.">86</a> along through the ice, and in the middle thereof wee cast out our leade, and had
90 fadome deepe; in the next quarter wee cast out the lead againe and had 100 fadome
deepe, and we sayled so farre into the ice that wee could goe no further: for we could
see no place where it <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>opened, but were forced (with great labour and paine) to lauere out of it againe,
the winde blowing west, and wee were then vnder seuentie foure degrees and tenne minutes.
</p>
<p>The fifteenth of July wee draue through the middle of the ice with a calme,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7443src" href="#xd33e7443" title="Go to note 87.">87</a> and casting out our leade had 100 fadome deepe, at which time the winde being east,
wee sayled [south-] west.
</p>
<p>The sixteenth of July wee got out of the ice, and sawe a great beare lying vpon it,
that leaped into the water when shee saw vs. Wee made towards her with our shippe;
which shee perceiuing, gotte vp vpon the ice againe, wherewith wee shot once at her.
</p>
<p>Then we sailed east south-east and saw no ice, gessing that wee were not farre from
Noua Zembla, because wee sawe the beare there vpon the ice, at which time we cast
out the lead and found 100 fadome deepe.
</p>
<p>The seuenteenth of July we tooke the height of the sunne, and it was eleuated aboue
the horizon 37 degrees and 55 minutes; his declination was 21 degrees and 15 minutes,
which taken from the height aforesaid, the height of the Pole was 74 degrees and 40
minutes:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7452src" href="#xd33e7452" title="Go to note 88.">88</a> and when the sunne was in the south [11 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], wee saw the land of Noua Zembla, which was about Lomsbay.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7523src" href="#xd33e7523" title="Go to note 89.">89</a> I was the first that espied <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>it. Then wee altered our course, and sayled north-east and by north, and hoysed vp
all our sailes except the fore-saile and the lesien.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7530src" href="#xd33e7530" title="Go to note 90.">90</a>
</p>
<p>The eighteenth of July wee saw the land againe, beeing vnder 75 degrees, and sayled
north-east and by north with a north-west winde, and wee gate aboue the point of the
Admirals Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7537src" href="#xd33e7537" title="Go to note 91.">91</a> and sayled east north-east with a west winde, the land reaching north-east and by
north.
</p>
<p>The nineteenth of July wee came to the Crosse-Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7544src" href="#xd33e7544" title="Go to note 92.">92</a> and could then get no further by reason of the ice, for there the ice lay still close
vpon the land, at which time the winde was west and blewe right vpon the land, and
it lay vnder 76 degrees and 20 minutes. There stood 2 crosses vpon the land, whereof
it had the name.
</p>
<p>The twenteeth of July wee anchored vnder the island, for wee could get no further
for the ice. There wee put out our boate, and with eight men rowed on land, and went
to one of the crosses, where we rested vs awhile, to goe to the next crosse, but beeing
in the way we saw two beares by the other crosse, at which time wee had no weapons
at all about vs. The beares rose vp vpon their hinder feete to see vs (for they smell
further than they see), and for that they smelt us, therefore they rose vpright and
came towards vs, wherewith we were not a little abashed, in such sort that wee had
little lust<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7549src" href="#xd33e7549" title="Go to note 93.">93</a> to laugh, and in all haste went to our boate againe, still looking behinde vs to
see if they followed vs, thinking to get into the boate and so put off from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>land: but the master<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7554src" href="#xd33e7554" title="Go to note 94.">94</a> stayed us, saying, hee that first beginnes to runne away, I will thrust this hake-staffe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7558src" href="#xd33e7558" title="Go to note 95.">95</a> (which hee then held in his hand) into his ribs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7563src" href="#xd33e7563" title="Go to note 96.">96</a> for it is better for vs (sayd hee) to stay altogether, and see if we can make them
afraid with whooping and hallowing; and so we went softly towards the boate, and gote
away glad that wee had escaped their clawes, and that wee had the leysure to tell
our fellowes thereof.
</p>
<p>The one and twenteeth of July wee tooke the height of the sunne, and found that it
was eleuated aboue the horizon thirtie fiue degrees and fifteene minutes; his declination
was one and twentie degrees, which being taken from the height aforesaide, there rested
fourteene degrees, which substracted from ninetie degrees, then the height of the
Pole was found to be seuentie sixe degrees and fifteene minutes:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7570src" href="#xd33e7570" title="Go to note 97.">97</a> then wee found the variation of the compasse to be iust twentie sixe degrees. The
same daye two of our men went againe to the crosse, and found no beares to trouble
vs, and wee followed them with our armes, fearing lest wee might meet any by chance;
and when we came to the second crosse, wee found the foote-steps of 2 beares, and
saw how long they had followed vs, which was an hundreth foote-steps at the least,
that way that wee had beene the day before.
</p>
<p>The two and twentie of July, being Monday, wee set vp another crosse and made our
marke[s] thereon, and lay there before the Cross Island till the fourth of August;
meane time we washt and whited<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7578src" href="#xd33e7578" title="Go to note 98.">98</a> our linnen on the shoare.
</p>
<p>The thirtie of July, the sunne being north [½ p. 10 <span class="asc">P.M.</span>], <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>there came a beare so neere to our shippe that wee might hit her with a stone, and
wee shot her into the foote with a peece, wherewith shee ranne halting away.
</p>
<p>The one and thirteeth of July, the sunne being east north-east [¾ p. 2 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], seuen of our men killed a beare, and fleaed her, and cast her body into the sea.
The same day at noone (by our instrument) wee found the variation of the nedle of
the compasse to be 17 degrees.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7595src" href="#xd33e7595" title="Go to note 99.">99</a>
</p>
<p>The first of August wee saw a white beare, but shee ranne away from vs.
</p>
<p>The fourth of August wee got out of the ice to the other side of the island, and anchored
there: where, with great labour and much paine, wee fetched a boate full of stones
from the land.
</p>
<p>The fifth of August wee set saile againe towardes Ice-point<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7602src" href="#xd33e7602" title="Go to note 100.">100</a> with an east wind, and sailed south south-east, and then north north-east, and saw
no ice by the land, by the which wee lauered.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7605src" href="#xd33e7605" title="Go to note 101.">101</a>
</p>
<p>The sixth of August we gate about the point of Nassawe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7612src" href="#xd33e7612" title="Go to note 102.">102</a> and sayled forward east and east and by south, along by the land.
</p>
<p>The seuenth of August wee had a west south-west wind, and sayled along by the land,
south-east and south-east and by east, and saw but a little ice, and then past by
the Trust-point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7619src" href="#xd33e7619" title="Go to note 103.">103</a> which wee had much longed for. At euening we had an east wind, with mistie weather,
so that wee were forced to make our ship fast to a peece of ice, that was at least
36 fadome deep vnder the water, and more than 16 fadome <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>aboue the water; which in all was 52 fadome thick, for it lay fast vpon ground the
which was 36 fadome deepe. The eight of August in the morning wee had an east wind
with mistie weather.
</p>
<p>The 9 of August, lying still fast to the great peece of ice, it snowed hard, and it
was misty weather, and when the sunne was south [¾ p. 10 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] we went vpon the hatches<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7631src" href="#xd33e7631" title="Go to note 104.">104</a> (for we alwayes held watch): where, as the master walked along the ship, he heard
a beast snuffe with his nose, and looking ouer-bord he saw a great beare hard by the
ship, wherewith he cryed out, a beare, a beare; and with that all our men came vp
from vnder hatches,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7636src" href="#xd33e7636" title="Go to note 105.">105</a> and saw a great beare hard by our boat, seeking to get into it, but wee giuing a
great shoute, shee was afrayd and swamme away, but presently came backe againe, and
went behinde a great peece of ice, whereunto wee had made our shippe fast, and climbed
vpon it, and boldly came towardes our shippe to enter into it:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7641src" href="#xd33e7641" title="Go to note 106.">106</a> but wee had torne our scute sayle in the shippe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7646src" href="#xd33e7646" title="Go to note 107.">107</a> and lay with foure peeces before at the bootesprit,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7652src" href="#xd33e7652" title="Go to note 108.">108</a> and shotte her into the body, and with that, shee ranne away; but it snowed so fast
that wee could not see whither shee went, but wee guest that she lay behinde a high
hoouell,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7659src" href="#xd33e7659" title="Go to note 109.">109</a> whereof there was many vpon the peece of ice.
</p>
<p>The tenth of August, being Saterday, the ice began mightily to breake,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7666src" href="#xd33e7666" title="Go to note 110.">110</a> and then wee first perceiued that the great peece of ice wherevnto wee had made our
shippe fast, lay on the ground; for the rest of the ice draue along by it, <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>wherewith wee were in great feare that wee should be compassed about with the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7673src" href="#xd33e7673" title="Go to note 111.">111</a> and therefore wee vsed all the diligence and meanes that wee could to get from thence,
for wee were in great doubt:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7678src" href="#xd33e7678" title="Go to note 112.">112</a> and being vnder sayle, wee sayled vpon the ice, because it was all broken vnder us,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7683src" href="#xd33e7683" title="Go to note 113.">113</a> and got to another peece of ice, wherevnto wee made our shippe faste againe with
our sheate anchor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7689src" href="#xd33e7689" title="Go to note 114.">114</a> which wee made fast vpon it, and there wee lay till euening. And when wee had supped,
in the first quarter<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7694src" href="#xd33e7694" title="Go to note 115.">115</a> the sayd peece of ice began on a sodaine to burst and rende in peeces, so fearefully
that it was admirable; for with one great cracke it burst into foure hundred peeces
at the least: wee lying fast to it,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7697src" href="#xd33e7697" title="Go to note 116.">116</a> weied our cable and got off from it. Vnder the water it was ten fadome deepe and
lay vpon the ground, and two fadome above the water: and it made a fearefull noyse
both vnder and aboue the water when it burst, and spread it selfe abroad on all sides.
</p>
<p>And being with great feare<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7704src" href="#xd33e7704" title="Go to note 117.">117</a> gotten from that peece of ice, we came to an other peece, that was size fadome deepe
vnder the water, to the which we made a rope fast on both sides.
</p>
<p>Then wee saw an other great peece of ice not farre from vs, lying fast in the sea,
that was as sharp aboue as it had been a tower; whereunto wee rowed, and casting out
our lead, wee found that it lay 20 fadome deepe, fast on the ground vnder the water,
and 12 fadome aboue the water.
</p>
<p>The 11 of August, being Sunday, wee rowed to another peece of ice, and cast out our
lead, and found that it lay 18 fadom deepe, fast to the ground vnder the water, and
10 <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>fadome aboue the water. The 12 of August we sailed neere<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7715src" href="#xd33e7715" title="Go to note 118.">118</a> vnder the land, y<sup>e</sup> better to shun y<sup>e</sup> ice, for y<sup>t</sup> the great flakes that draue in the sea<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7730src" href="#xd33e7730" title="Go to note 119.">119</a> were many fadome deepe under the water, and we were better defended from them being
at 4 and 5 fadome water; and there ran a great current of water from the hill[s].
There we made our ship fast againe to a peece of ice, and called that point the small
Ice Point.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7735src" href="#xd33e7735" title="Go to note 120.">120</a>
</p>
<p>The 13 of August in the morning, there came a beare from<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7742src" href="#xd33e7742" title="Go to note 121.">121</a> the east point of the land, close to our ship, and one of our men with a peece shot
at her and brake one of her legs, but she crept<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7747src" href="#xd33e7747" title="Go to note 122.">122</a> vp the hill with her three feet, and wee following her killed her, and hauing fleaed
her brought the skinne aboard the ship. From thence we set saile with a little gale
of winde,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7752src" href="#xd33e7752" title="Go to note 123.">123</a> and were forced to lauere, but after that it began to blow more<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7757src" href="#xd33e7757" title="Go to note 124.">124</a> out of the south and south south-east.
</p>
<p>The 15 of August we came to the Island of Orange,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7764src" href="#xd33e7764" title="Go to note 125.">125</a> where we were inclosed with the ice hard by a great peece of ice where we were in
great danger to loose our ship, but with great labour and much paine we got to the
island, the winde being south-east, whereby we were constrained to turne our ship;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7771src" href="#xd33e7771" title="Go to note 126.">126</a> and while we were busied thereabouts and made much noise, a beare that lay there
and slept, awaked and came towards vs to the ship, so that we were forced to leaue
our worke about turning of the ship, and to defend our selues against the beare, and
shot her into the body, wherewith she ran away to the other side of the island, and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>swam into the water, and got vp vpon a peece of ice, where shee lay still; but we
comming after her to the peece of ice where shee lay, when she saw vs she leapt into
the water and swam to the land, but we got betweene her and the land, and stroke her
on the head with a hatchet, but as often as we stroke at her with the hatchet, she
duckt vnder the water, whereby we had much to do before we could kill her: after she
was dead we fleaed her on the land, and tooke the skin on board with vs, and after
that turned<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7778src" href="#xd33e7778" title="Go to note 127.">127</a> our ship to a great peece of ice, and made it fast thereunto.
</p>
<p>The 16 of August ten of our men entring into one boat, rowed to the firm land at Noua
Zembla, and drew the boate vp vpon the ice; which done, we went vp a high hill to
see the cituation of the land, and found that it reached south-east and south south-east,
and then againe south, which we disliked, for that it lay so much southward: but when
we saw open water south-east and east south-east, we were much comforted againe, thinking
y<sup>t</sup> wee had woon our voyage,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7788src" href="#xd33e7788" title="Go to note 128.">128</a> and knew not how we should get soone inough on boord to certifie William Barents
thereof.
</p>
<p>The 18 of August we made preparation to set saile, but it was all in vaine; for we
had almost lost our sheat anchor<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7797src" href="#xd33e7797" title="Go to note 129.">129</a> and two new ropes, and with much lost labour got to the place againe from whence
we came: for the streame ran with a mighty current, and the ice drave very strongly
vpon the cables along by the shippe, so that we were in fear that we should loose
all the cable that was without the ship, which was 200 fadome at the least; but God
prouided well for vs, so that in the end wee got to the place againe from whence we
put out.
</p>
<p>The 19 of August it was indifferent good weather, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>winde blowing south-west, the ice still driuing, and we set saile with an indifferent
gale of wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7806src" href="#xd33e7806" title="Go to note 130.">130</a> and past by y<sup>e</sup> Point of Desire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7814src" href="#xd33e7814" title="Go to note 131.">131</a> whereby we were once againe in good hope. And when we had gotten aboue the point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7819src" href="#xd33e7819" title="Go to note 132.">132</a> we sailed south-east into the sea-ward 4 [16] miles, but then againe we entred into
more ice, whereby we were constrained to turn back againe, and sailed north-west vntil
we came to y<sup>e</sup> land againe, which reacheth frō the Point of Desire to the Head Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7828src" href="#xd33e7828" title="Go to note 133.">133</a> south and by west, 6 [24] miles: from the Head Point to Flushingers Head,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7832src" href="#xd33e7832" title="Go to note 134.">134</a> it reacheth south-west, which are 3 [12] miles one from the other; from the Flushingers
Head, it reacheth into the sea east south-east, and from Flushingers Head to the Point
of the Island<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7837src" href="#xd33e7837" title="Go to note 135.">135</a> it reacheth south-west and by south and south-west 3 [12] miles; and from the Island
Point to the Point of the Ice Hauen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7844src" href="#xd33e7844" title="Go to note 136.">136</a> the land reacheth west south-west 4 [16] miles: from the Ice Hauens Point to the
fall of water or the Streame Bay<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7849src" href="#xd33e7849" title="Go to note 137.">137</a> and the low land, it reacheth west and by south and east and by north, 7 [28] miles:
from thence the land reacheth east and west.
</p>
<p>The 21 of August we sailed a great way into the Ice Hauen, and that night ankored
therein: next day, the streame<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7855src" href="#xd33e7855" title="Go to note 138.">138</a> going extreame hard eastward, we haled out againe from thence, and sailed againe
to the Island Point; but for that it was misty weather, comming to a peece of ice,
we made the ship fast thereunto, because the winde began to blow hard south-west and
south south-west. There we <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>went<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7862src" href="#xd33e7862" title="Go to note 139.">139</a> vp vpon the ice, and wondred much thereat, it was such manner of ice: for on the
top it was ful of earth, and there we found aboue 40 egges, and it was not like other
ice, for it was of a perfect azure coloure, like to the skies, whereby there grew
great contentiō in words amongst our men, some saying that it was ice, others that
it was frozen land; for it lay vnreasonable high aboue the water, it was at least
18 fadome vnder the water close to the ground, and 10 fadome aboue the water: there
we stayed all that storme, the winde being south-west and by west.
</p>
<p>The 23 of August we sailed againe from the ice south-eastward into the sea, but entred
presently into it againe, and wound about<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7869src" href="#xd33e7869" title="Go to note 140.">140</a> to the Ice Hauen. The next day it blew hard north north-west, and the ice came mightily
driuing in, whereby we were in a manner compassed about therewith, and withall the
winde began more and more to rise, and the ice still draue harder and harder, so that
the pin of the rother<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7874src" href="#xd33e7874" title="Go to note 141.">141</a> and the rother were shorne in peeces,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7879src" href="#xd33e7879" title="Go to note 142.">142</a> and our boate was shorne in peeces<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7884src" href="#xd33e7884" title="Go to note 143.">143</a> betweene the ship and the ice, we expecting nothing else but that the ship also would
be prest and crusht in peeces with the ice.
</p>
<p>The 25 of August the weather began to be better, and we tooke great paines and bestowed
much labour to get the ice, wherewith we were so inclosed, to go from vs, but what
meanes soeuer we vsed it was all in vaine. But when the sun was south-west [½ p. 2
<span class="asc">P.M.</span>] the ice began to driue out againe with the streame,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7894src" href="#xd33e7894" title="Go to note 144.">144</a> and we thought to saile southward about Noua Zembla, [and so westwards] to the Straites
of Mergates.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7899src" href="#xd33e7899" title="Go to note 145.">145</a> For that seeing we could there find no passage, we hauing past<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7903src" href="#xd33e7903" title="Go to note 146.">146</a> Noua Zembla, [we] were of opinion that our <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>labour was all in vaine and that we could not get through, and so agreed to go that
way home againe; but comming to the Streame Bay, we were forced to go back againe,
because of the ice which lay so fast thereabouts; and the same night also it froze,
that we could hardly get through there with the little wind that we had, the winde
then being north.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 26 of August there blew a reasonable gale of winde, at which time we determined
to saile back to the Point of Desire, and so home againe, seeing <span class="corr" id="xd33e7915" title="Source: yt">y<sup>t</sup></span> we could not get through [by the way towards] y<sup>e</sup> Wergats,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7928src" href="#xd33e7928" title="Go to note 147.">147</a> although we vsed al the meanes and industry we could to get forward; but whē we had
past by y<sup>e</sup> Ice Hauen y<sup>e</sup> ice began to driue w<sup>t</sup> such force, y<sup>t</sup> we were inclosed round about therewith, and yet we sought al the meanes we could
to get out, but it was all in vaine. And at that time we had like to haue lost three
men that were vpon the ice to make way for the ship, if the ice had held y<sup>e</sup> course it went; but as we draue back againe, and that the ice also whereon our men
stood in like sort draue, they being nimble, as y<sup>e</sup> ship draue by thē, one of them caught hould of the beake head, another vpon the shroudes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7951src" href="#xd33e7951" title="Go to note 148.">148</a> and the third vpon the great brase<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7956src" href="#xd33e7956" title="Go to note 149.">149</a> that hung out behind, and so by great aduenture by the hold that they took they got
safe into the shippe againe, for which they thanked God with all their hearts: for
it was much liklier that they should rather haue beene carried away with the ice,
but God, by the nimbleness of their hands, deliuered them out of that danger, which
was a pittifull thing to behold, although it fell out for the best, for if they had
not beene nimble they had surely dyed for it.
</p>
<p>The same day in the euening we got to the west side of the Ice Hauen, where we were
forced, in great cold, pouerty, misery, and griefe, to stay all that winter; the winde
then being east north-east.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 27 of August the ice draue round about the ship, and yet it was good wether; at
which time we went on land, and being there it began to blow south-east with a reasonable
gale, and then the ice came with great force before the bough,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7966src" href="#xd33e7966" title="Go to note 150.">150</a> and draue the ship vp foure foote high before, and behind it seemed as if the keele
lay on the ground, so that it seemed that the ship would be ouerthrowne in the place;
whereupon they that were in the ship put out the boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7969src" href="#xd33e7969" title="Go to note 151.">151</a> therewith to saue their liues, and withall put out a flagge to make a signe to vs
to come on board: which we perceiuing, and beholding the ship to be lifted vp in that
sort, made all the haste we could to get on board, thinking that the ship was burst
in peeces, but comming vnto it we found it to be in better case than we thought it
had beene.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate05width" id="plate05"><img src="images/plate05.png" alt="How the ice heaved up the fore part of our ship." width="720" height="550"><p class="figureHead">How the ice heaved up the fore part of our ship.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 28 of August wee gat some of the ice from it,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7980src" href="#xd33e7980" title="Go to note 152.">152</a> and the ship began to sit vpright againe; but before it was fully vpright, as William
Barents and the other pilot went forward to the bough,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7985src" href="#xd33e7985" title="Go to note 153.">153</a> to see how the ship lay and how much it was risen, and while they were busie vpon
their knees and elbowes to measure how much it was, the ship burst out of the ice
with such a noyse and so great a crack, that they thought verily that they were all
cast away, knowing not how to saue themselues.
</p>
<p>The 29 of August, the ship lying vpright againe, we vsed all the meanes we could,
with yron hookes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e7990src" href="#xd33e7990" title="Go to note 154.">154</a> and other instruments, <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>to breake the flakes of ice that lay one heap’d vpō the other, but al in vaine; so
that we determined to commit our selues to the mercie of God, and to attend ayde from
him, for that the ice draue not away in any such sort that it could helpe vs.
</p>
<p>The 30 of August the ice began to driue together one vpon the other with greater force
than before, and bare against the ship w<sup>h</sup> a boystrous south [by] west wind and a great snowe, so that all the whole ship was
borne vp and inclosed,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8008src" href="#xd33e8008" title="Go to note 155.">155</a> whereby all that was both about and in it began to crack, so that it seemed to burst
in a 100 peeces, which was most fearfull both to see and heare, and made all y<sup>e</sup> haire of our heads to rise vpright with feare; and after y<sup>t</sup>, the ship (by the ice on both sides that joined and got vnder the same) was driued
so vpright, in such sort as if it had bin lifted vp with a wrench or vice.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8019src" href="#xd33e8019" title="Go to note 156.">156</a>
</p>
<p>The 31 of August, by the force of the ice, the ship was driuen vp 4 or 5 foote high
at the beake head,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8026src" href="#xd33e8026" title="Go to note 157.">157</a> and the hinder part thereof lay in a clift<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8031src" href="#xd33e8031" title="Go to note 158.">158</a> of ice, whereby we thought that the ruther would be freed from the force of the flakes
of ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8034src" href="#xd33e8034" title="Go to note 159.">159</a> but, notwithstanding, it brake in peeces staffe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8039src" href="#xd33e8039" title="Go to note 160.">160</a> and all: and if that the hinder part of the ship had bin in the ice that draue as
well as the fore part was, then all the ship<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8044src" href="#xd33e8044" title="Go to note 161.">161</a> would haue bin driuen wholly vpon the ice, or possibly haue ran on groūd,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8050src" href="#xd33e8050" title="Go to note 162.">162</a> and for that cause wee were in great feare, and set our scutes and our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8055src" href="#xd33e8055" title="Go to note 163.">163</a> out vpon the ice, if neede were, to saue our selues. But within 4 houres after, the
ice draue awaye of it selfe, wherewith we were exceeding glad, as if we had saued
our liues, for that the ship was then on <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>float againe; and vpon that we made a new ruther and a staffe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8062src" href="#xd33e8062" title="Go to note 164.">164</a> and hung the ruther out vpon the hooks, that if we chanced to be born<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8067src" href="#xd33e8067" title="Go to note 165.">165</a> vpon the ice againe, as we had bin, it might so be freed from it.
</p>
<p>The 1 of September, being Sunday, while we were at praier, the ice began to gather
together againe, so that the ship was lifted vp [bodily] two foote at the least, but
the ice brake not.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8072src" href="#xd33e8072" title="Go to note 166.">166</a> The same euening<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8079src" href="#xd33e8079" title="Go to note 167.">167</a> the ice continued in y<sup>t</sup> sort still driuing and gathering together, so that we made preparation to draw our
scute and the boate ouer the ice vpon the land, the wind then blowing south-east.
</p>
<p>The 2 of September it snowed hard with a north-east wind, and the ship began to rise
vp higher vpō the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8089src" href="#xd33e8089" title="Go to note 168.">168</a> at which time the ice burst and crakt with great force, so that we were of opinion
to carry our scute on land in that fowle weather, with 13 barrels of bread and two
hogsheads<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8094src" href="#xd33e8094" title="Go to note 169.">169</a> of wine to sustaine our selues if need were.
</p>
<p>The 3 of September it blew [just as] hard, but snowed not so much, y<sup>e</sup> wind being north north-east; at which time we began to be loose from the ice whereunto
we lay fast, so that the scheck brake from the steuen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8104src" href="#xd33e8104" title="Go to note 170.">170</a> but the planks wherewith the ship was lyned held the scheck fast and made it hang
on;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8109src" href="#xd33e8109" title="Go to note 171.">171</a> but the boutloofe and a new cable, if we had falled vpon the ice, brake by the forcible
pressing of the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8114src" href="#xd33e8114" title="Go to note 172.">172</a> but held fast <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>againe in the ice; and yet the ship was staunch, which was wonder, in regard y<sup>t</sup> ye ice draue so hard and in great heapes as big as the salt hills that are in Spaine,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8133src" href="#xd33e8133" title="Go to note 173.">173</a> and within a harquebus shot of the ship, betweene the which we lay in great feare
and anguishe.
</p>
<p>The 4 of September the weather began to cleare vp and we sawe the sunne, but it was
very cold, the wind being north-east, we being forced to lye still.
</p>
<p>The 5 of September it was faire sunshine weather and very calme; and at euening, when
we had supt, the ice compassed about us againe, and we were hard inclosed therewith,
the ship beginning to lye upon the one side and leakt sore,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8144src" href="#xd33e8144" title="Go to note 174.">174</a> but by Gods grace it became staunch againe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8149src" href="#xd33e8149" title="Go to note 175.">175</a> wherewith<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8154src" href="#xd33e8154" title="Go to note 176.">176</a> we were wholly in feare to loose the ship, it was in so great danger. At which time
we tooke counsell together and caried our old sock saile,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8159src" href="#xd33e8159" title="Go to note 177.">177</a> with pouder, lead, peeces, muskets, and other furniture on land, to make a tent [or
hut] about our scute y<sup>t</sup> we had drawē vpon the land; and at that time we carried some bread and wine on land
also, with some timber,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8168src" href="#xd33e8168" title="Go to note 178.">178</a> therewith to mend our boate, that it might serve vs in time of neede.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 6 of September it was indifferent faire sea-wether<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8176src" href="#xd33e8176" title="Go to note 179.">179</a> and sun-shine, the wind being west, whereby we were somewhat comforted, hoping that
the ice would driue away and that we might get from thence againe.
</p>
<p>The 7 of September it was indifferent wether againe, but we perceiued no opening of
the water, but to the contrary it<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8183src" href="#xd33e8183" title="Go to note 180.">180</a> lay hard inclosed with ice, and no water at all about the ship, no not so much as
a bucket full. The same day 5 of our men went on land, but 2 of them came back againe;
the other three went forward about 2 [8] miles into the land, and there found a riuer
of sweet water, where also they found great store of wood that had bin driuen thither,
and there they foūd the foote-steps of harts and hinds,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8188src" href="#xd33e8188" title="Go to note 181.">181</a> as they thought, for they were clouen footed, some greater footed than others, which
made them iudge them to be so.
</p>
<p>The 8 of September it blew hard east north-east, which was a right contrary wind to
doe vs any good touching the carrying away of the ice, so that we were stil faster
in the ice, which put vs in no small discomfort.
</p>
<p>The 9 of September it blew [strongly from the] north-east, with a little snowe, whereby
our ship was wholly inclosed with ice, for y<sup>e</sup> wind draue the ice hard against it, so that we lay 3 or 4 foote deepe in the ice,
and our sheck in the after-steuer brake in peeces<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8199src" href="#xd33e8199" title="Go to note 182.">182</a> and the ship began to be somewhat loose before, but yet it was not much hurt.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the night time two beares came close to our ship side, but we sounded our trumpet
and shot at them, but hit them not because it was darke, and they ran away.
</p>
<p>The 10 of September the wether was somewhat better, because the wind blew not so hard,
and yet all one wind.
</p>
<p>The 11 of September it was calme wether, and 8 of vs went on land, euery man armed,
to see if that were true as our other three companions had said, that there lay wood
about the riuer; for that seeing we had so long wound and turned about, sometime in
the ice, and then againe got out, and thereby were compelled to alter our course,
and at last sawe that we could not get out of the ice but rather became faster, and
could not loose our ship as at other times we had done, as also that it began to be
[near autumn and] winter, we tooke counsell together what we were best to doe according
to the [circumstances of the] time, [in order] that we might winter there and attend
such aduenture as God would send vs: and after we had debated vpon the matter, to
keepe and defend ourselues both from the cold and the wild beastes, we determined
to build a [shed or] house vpon the land, to keep vs therein as well as we could,
and so to commit ourselves vnto the tuition of God. And to that end we went further
into the land, to find out <span class="right-marginnote">How God in our extremest need, when we were forced to live all the winter upon the
land, sent vs wood to make vs a house and to serue vs to burne in the cold winter.</span> the conuenientest place in our opinions to raise our house vpon, and yet we had not
much stuffe to make it withall, in regard that there grew no trees, nor any other
thing in that country convenient to build it withall. But we leauing no occasion unsought,
as our men went abroad to view the country, and to see what good fortune might happen
unto vs, at last we found an unexpected comfort in our need, which was that we found
certaine trees roots and all, (as our three companions had said before<span class="corr" id="xd33e8212" title="Not in source">)</span>, which had been driuen vpon the shoare, either from Tartaria, Muscouia, or elsewhere,
for there was none growing vpon that land; wherewith (as if God had purposely sent
them vnto vs) we were <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>much comforted, being in good hope that God would shew us some further fauour; for
that wood served vs not onely to build our house, but also to burne and serve vs all
the winter long; otherwise without all doubt we had died there miserably with extreme
cold.
</p>
<p>The 12 of September it was calme wether, and then our men went vnto the other side
of the land, to see if they could finde any wood neerer vnto vs, but there was none.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8218src" href="#xd33e8218" title="Go to note 183.">183</a>
</p>
<p>The 13 of September it was calme but very mistie wether, so that we could doe nothing,
because it was dangerous for vs to go into the land, in regard that we could not see
the wild beares; and yet they could smell vs, for they smell better than they see.
</p>
<p>The 14 of September it was cleere sunshine wether, but very cold; and then we went
into the land, and laid the wood in heapes one vpō the other, that it might not be
couered over with y<sup>e</sup> snow, and from thence ment<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8230src" href="#xd33e8230" title="Go to note 184.">184</a> to carry it to the place where we intended to builde our house.
</p>
<p>The 15 of September in the morning, as one of our men held watch, wee saw three beares,
whereof the one lay still behind a piece of ice [and] the other two came close to
the ship, which we perceiuing, made our peeces ready to shoote at them; at which time
there stod a tob full of beefe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8235src" href="#xd33e8235" title="Go to note 185.">185</a> vpon the ice, which lay in the water to be seasoned,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8240src" href="#xd33e8240" title="Go to note 186.">186</a> for that close by the ship there was no water; one of the beares went vnto it, and
put in his head [into the tub] to take out a peece of the beefe, but she fared therewith
as the dog did with y<sup>e</sup> pudding;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8248src" href="#xd33e8248" title="Go to note 187.">187</a> for as she was snatching at the beefe, she was shot into the head, wherewith she
fell downe dead and neuer <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>stir’d. [There we saw a curious sight]: the other beare stood still, and lokt vpon
her fellow [as if wondering why she remained so motionless]; and when she had stood
a good while she smelt her fellow, and perceiuing that she [lay still and] was dead,
she ran away, but we tooke halberts and other armes with vs and followed her.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8256src" href="#xd33e8256" title="Go to note 188.">188</a> And at last she came againe towardes us, and we prepared our selues to withstand
her, wherewith she rose vp vpon her hinder feet, thinking to rampe at vs; but while
she reared herselfe vp, one of our men shot her into the belly, and with that she
fell vpon her fore-feet again, and roaring as loud as she could, ran away. Then we
tooke the dead beare, and ript her belly open; and taking out her guts we set her
vpon her fore-feet, so that she might freeze as she stood, intending to carry her
w<sup>t</sup> vs into Holland if we might get our ship loose: and when we had set y<sup>e</sup> beare vpon her foure feet, we began to make a slead, thereon to drawe the wood to
the place where we ment<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8267src" href="#xd33e8267" title="Go to note 189.">189</a> to build our house. At that time it froze two fingers thicke in the salt water [of
the sea], and it was exceeding cold, the wind blowing north-east.
</p>
<p>The 16 of September the sunne shone, but towardes the euening it was misty, the wind
being easterly; at which time we went [for the first time] to fetch wood with our
sleads, and then we drew foure beames aboue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8273src" href="#xd33e8273" title="Go to note 190.">190</a> a mile [4 miles] vpon the ice and the snow. That night againe it frose aboue two
fingers thicke.
</p>
<p>The 17 of September thirteene of vs went where the wood lay with our sleads, and so
drew fiue and fiue in a slead, and the other three helped to lift the wood behind,
to make vs draw the better and with more ease;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8280src" href="#xd33e8280" title="Go to note 191.">191</a> and in that manner we <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>drew wood twice a day, and laid it on a heape by the place where we ment to build
our house.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 18 of September the wind blew west, but it snowed hard, and we went on land againe
to continue our labour to draw wood to our place appointed, and after dinner the sun
shone and it was calme wether.
</p>
<p>The 19 of September it was calme sunshine wether, and we drew two sleads full of wood
sixe thousand paces long,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8294src" href="#xd33e8294" title="Go to note 192.">192</a> and that we did twice a day.
</p>
<p>[The 20 of September we again made two journeys with the sledges, and it was misty
and still weather.]
</p>
<p>The 21 of September it was misty wether, but towards euening it cleared vp, and the
ice still draue in the sea, but not so strongly as it did before, but yet it was very
cold, [so that we were forced to bring our caboose<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8302src" href="#xd33e8302" title="Go to note 193.">193</a> below, because everything froze above.]
</p>
<p>The 22 of September it was faire still weather, but very cold, the wind being west.
</p>
<p>The 23 of September we fetcht more wood to build our house, which we did twice a day,
but it grew to be misty and still weather againe, the wind blowing east and east-north-east.
That day our carpentur (being of Purmecaet<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8310src" href="#xd33e8310" title="Go to note 194.">194</a>) dyed as we came aboord about euening.
</p>
<p>The 24 of September we buryed him vnder the sieges<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8318src" href="#xd33e8318" title="Go to note 195.">195</a> in the clift of a hill, hard by the water,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8323src" href="#xd33e8323" title="Go to note 196.">196</a> for we could not dig vp the earth by reason of the great frost and cold; and that
day we went twice with our sleads to fetch wood.
</p>
<p>The 25 of September it was darke weather, the wind blowing west and west south-west
and south-west, and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>ice begā somewhat to open and driue away; but it continued not long, for that hauing
driuen about the length of the shott of a great peece,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8332src" href="#xd33e8332" title="Go to note 197.">197</a> it lay three fadomes deepe vpon the ground: and where we lay the ice draue not, for
we lay in the middle of the ice; but if we had layne in the [open or] maine sea, we
would haue hoysed sayle, although it was thē late in the yeare. The same day we raised
up the principles<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8337src" href="#xd33e8337" title="Go to note 198.">198</a> of our house, and began to worke hard thereon; but if the ship had bin loose we would
haue left our building and haue made our after steuen of our ship,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8342src" href="#xd33e8342" title="Go to note 199.">199</a> that we might haue bin ready to saile away if it had bin possible; for that it grieued
vs much to lye there all that cold winter, which we knew would fall out to be extreame
bitter; but being bereaued of all hope, we were compelled to make necessity a vertue,
and with patience to attend what issue God would send vs.
</p>
<p>The 26 of September we had a west wind and an open sea, but our ship lay fast, wherewith
we were not a little greeued; but it was God’s will, which we most<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8349src" href="#xd33e8349" title="Go to note 200.">200</a> patiently bare,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8352src" href="#xd33e8352" title="Go to note 201.">201</a> and we began to make up our house:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8355src" href="#xd33e8355" title="Go to note 202.">202</a> part of our men fetch’d wood to burne, the rest played the carpenters and were busie
aboute the house. As then we were sixteene men in all, for our carpenter was dead,
and of our sixteene men there was still one or other sicke.
</p>
<p>The 27th of September it blew hard north-east, and it frose so hard that as we put
a nayle into our mouths (as when men worke carpenters worke they vse to doe), there
would ice hang thereon when we tooke it out againe, and made the blood follow. The
same day there came an old <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>beare and a yong one towards vs as we were going to our house, beeing altogether (for
we durst not go alone), which we thought to shoot at, but she ran away. At which time
the ice came forcibly driuing in, and it was faire sunshine weather, but so extreame
cold that we could hardly worke, but extremity forced vs thereunto.
</p>
<p>The 28 of September it was faire weather and the sun shon, the wind being west and
very calme, the sea as then being open, but our ship lay fast in the ice and stirred
not. The same day there came a beare to the ship, but when she espied vs she ran away,
and we made as much hast as we could<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8366src" href="#xd33e8366" title="Go to note 203.">203</a> to build our house.
</p>
<p>The 29 of September in the morning, the wind was west, and after-noone it [again]
blew east,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8373src" href="#xd33e8373" title="Go to note 204.">204</a> and then we saw three beares betweene vs and the house, an old one and two yong;
but we notwithstanding drew our goods from the ship to the house, and so got before
y<sup>e</sup> beares, and yet they followed vs: neuertheless we would not shun the way for them,
but hollowed out as loud as we could, thinking that they would haue gone away; but
they would not once go out of their foote-path, but got before vs, wherewith we and
they that were at the house made a great noise, which made the beares runne away,
and we were not a little glad thereof.
</p>
<p>The 30 of September the wind was east and east south-east, and all that night and
the next day it snowed so fast that our men could fetch no wood, it lay so close and
high one vpon the other. Then we made a great fire without the house, therewith to
thaw the ground, that so we might lay it about the house that it might be the closer;
but it was all lost labour, for the earth was so hard and frozen so deep into the
ground, that we could not thaw it, and it would haue cost vs too much wood, and therefore
we were forced to leaue off that labour.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first of October the winde blew stiffe north-east, and after noone it blew north
with a great storme and drift of snow, whereby we could hardly go in<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8385src" href="#xd33e8385" title="Go to note 205.">205</a> the winde, and a man could hardly draw his breath, the snowe draue so hard in our
faces; at which time wee could not see two [or three] ships length from vs.
</p>
<p>The 2 of October before noone the sun shone, and after noone it was cloudy againe
and it snew, but the weather was still, the winde being north and then south, and
we set vp our house<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8392src" href="#xd33e8392" title="Go to note 206.">206</a> and vpon it we placed a may-pole<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8399src" href="#xd33e8399" title="Go to note 207.">207</a> made of frozen snowe.
</p>
<p>The 3 of October before noone it was a calme son-shine weather, but so cold that it
was hard to be endured; and after noone it blew hard out of the west, with so great
and extreame cold, that if it had continued we should haue beene forced to leaue our
worke.
</p>
<p>The fourth of October the winde was west, and after noone north with great store of
snow, whereby we could not worke; at that time we brought our [bower] ankor vpon the
ice to lye the faster, when we lay<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8423src" href="#xd33e8423" title="Go to note 208.">208</a> but an arrow shot from the [open] water, the ice was so much driuen away.
</p>
<p>The 5 of October it blew hard north-west, and the sea was <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>very open<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8433src" href="#xd33e8433" title="Go to note 209.">209</a> and without ice as farre as we could discerne; but we lay still frozen as we did
before, and our ship lay two or three foote deepe in the ice, and we could not perceiue
otherwise but that we lay fast vpon the ground,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8438src" href="#xd33e8438" title="Go to note 210.">210</a> and there<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8443src" href="#xd33e8443" title="Go to note 211.">211</a> it was three fadome and a halfe deepe. The same day we brake vp the lower deck of
the fore-part<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8447src" href="#xd33e8447" title="Go to note 212.">212</a> of our ship, and with those deales<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8453src" href="#xd33e8453" title="Go to note 213.">213</a> we couered our house, and made it slope ouer head<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8458src" href="#xd33e8458" title="Go to note 214.">214</a> that the water might run off; at which time it was very cold.
</p>
<p>The 6 of October it blew hard west [and] south-west, but towardes euening west north-west,
with a great snow [so] that we could hardly thrust our heads out of the dore by reason
of y<sup>e</sup> great cold.
</p>
<p>The 7 of October it was indifferent good wether, but yet very cold, and we calk’t
our house, and brake the ground about it at the foote thereof:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8470src" href="#xd33e8470" title="Go to note 215.">215</a> that day the winde went round about the compasse.
</p>
<p>The 8 of October, all the night before it blew so hard and the same day also, and
snowed so fast that we should haue smothered if we had gone out into the aire; and
to speake truth, it had not beene possible for any man to haue gone one ships length,
though his life had laine thereon; for it was not possible for vs to goe out of the
house or ship.
</p>
<p>The 9 of October the winde still continued north, and blew and snowed hard all that
day, the wind as then blowing from the land; so that all that day we were forced to
stay in the ship, the wether was so foule.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 10 of October the weather was somewhat fairer and the winde calmer, and [it] blew
south-west and west southwest;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8481src" href="#xd33e8481" title="Go to note 216.">216</a> and that time the water flowed two foote higher then ordinary, which wee gest to
proceede from the strong<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8487src" href="#xd33e8487" title="Go to note 217.">217</a> north wind which as then had blowne. The same day the wether began to be somewhat
better, so that we began to go out of our ship againe; and as one of our men went
out, he chaunced to meete a beare, and was almost at him before he knew it, but presently
he ranne backe againe towards the ship and the beare after him: but the beare comming
to the place where before that we killed another beare and set her vpright and there
let her freeze, which after was couered ouer with ice<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8491src" href="#xd33e8491" title="Go to note 218.">218</a> and yet one of her pawes reached aboue it, shee stood still, whereby our man got
before her and clome<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8496src" href="#xd33e8496" title="Go to note 219.">219</a> vp into the ship in great feare, crying, a beare, a beare; which we hearing came
aboue hatches<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8499src" href="#xd33e8499" title="Go to note 220.">220</a> to looke on her and to shoote at her, but we could not see her by meanes of the exceeding
great smoake that had so sore termented vs while we lay vnder hatches in the foule
wether, which we would not haue indured for any money; but by reason of the cold and
snowy wether we were constrained to do it if we would saue our liues, for aloft in
the ship<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8505src" href="#xd33e8505" title="Go to note 221.">221</a> we must vndoubtedly haue dyed. The beare staied not long there, but run away, the
wind then being north-east.
</p>
<p>The same day about euening it was faire wether, and we went out of our ship to the
house, and carryed the greatest part of our bread thither.
</p>
<p>The 11 of October it was calme wether, the wind being south and somewhat warme, and
then we carryed our wine and other victuals on land; and as we were hoysing the wine
ouer-boord, there came a beare towards our ship that had laine behinde a peece of
ice, and it seemed that we had <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>waked her with the noise we made; for we had seene her lye there, but we thought her
to be a peece of ice; but as she came neere vs we shot at her, and shee ran away,
so we proceeded in our worke.
</p>
<p>The 12 of October it blew north and [at times] somewhat westerly, and then halfe of
our men [went and] slept<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8517src" href="#xd33e8517" title="Go to note 222.">222</a> in the house, and that was the first time that we lay in it; but we indured great
cold because our cabins were not made, and besides that we had not clothes inough,
and we could keepe no fire because our chimney was not made, whereby it smoaked exceedingly.
</p>
<p>The 13 of October the wind was north and north-west, and it began againe to blow hard,
and then three of vs went a boord the ship and laded a slead with beere; but when
we had laden it, thinking to go to our house with it, sodainly there rose such a wind
and so great a storme and cold, that we were forced to go into the ship againe, because
we were not able to stay without; and we could not get the beere into the ship againe,
but were forced to let it stand without vpon the sleade. Being in the ship, we indured
extreame cold because we had but a few clothes in it.
</p>
<p>The 14 of October, as we came out of the ship, we found the barrell of beere standing
[in the open air] vpon the sleade, but it was fast frozen at the heads,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8524src" href="#xd33e8524" title="Go to note 223.">223</a> yet by reason of <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>the great cold the beere that purged out<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8589src" href="#xd33e8589" title="Go to note 224.">224</a> frose as hard vpon the side<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8594src" href="#xd33e8594" title="Go to note 225.">225</a> of the barrel as if it had bin glewed thereon, and in that sort we drew it to our
house and set the barrel an end, and dranke it first vp; but we were forced to melt
the beere, for there was scant<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8599src" href="#xd33e8599" title="Go to note 226.">226</a> any vnfrozen beere in the barrell, but in that thicke yeast that was vnfrozen lay
the strength of the beere,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8603src" href="#xd33e8603" title="Go to note 227.">227</a> so that it was too strong to drinke alone, and that which was frozen tasted like
water; and being melted we mixt one with the other, and so dranke it, but it had neither
strength nor tast.
</p>
<p>The 15 of October the wind blew north and [also] east and east south-east [and it
was still weather]. That day we made place to set vp our dore, and shouled<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8613src" href="#xd33e8613" title="Go to note 228.">228</a> the snowe away.
</p>
<p>The 16 of October the wind blew south-east and south,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8618src" href="#xd33e8618" title="Go to note 229.">229</a> with faire calme weather. The same night there had bin a beare in our ship, but in
the morning she went out againe when she saw our men. At the same time we brake vp
another peece of our ship,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8622src" href="#xd33e8622" title="Go to note 230.">230</a> to vse the deales about the protall,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8627src" href="#xd33e8627" title="Go to note 231.">231</a> which as then we began to make.
</p>
<p>The 17 of October the wind was south and south-east, calme weather, but very cold;
and that day we were busied about our portaile.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 18 of October the wind blew hard east [and] south-east, and then we fetched our
bread out of the scute which we had drawne vp vpon the land, and the wine also, which
as then was not much frozen, and yet it had layne sixe weeks therein, and notwithstanding
that it had often times frozen very hard. The same day we saw an other beare, and
then the sea was so couered ouer with ice that we could see no open water.
</p>
<p>The 19 of October y<sup>e</sup> wind blew north-east, and then there was but two men and a boy in the ship, at which
time there came a beare that sought forcibly to get into the ship, although the two
men shot at her with peeces of wood,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8641src" href="#xd33e8641" title="Go to note 232.">232</a> and yet she ventured vpon them,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8646src" href="#xd33e8646" title="Go to note 233.">233</a> whereby they were in an extreame feare; [and] each of them seeking to saue them selues,
the two men leapt into the balust,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8651src" href="#xd33e8651" title="Go to note 234.">234</a> and the boy clomed into the foot mast top<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8656src" href="#xd33e8656" title="Go to note 235.">235</a> to saue their liues; meane time some of our men shot at her with a musket, and then
shee ran away.
</p>
<p>The 20 of October it was calme sunshine weather, and then againe we saw the sea open,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8663src" href="#xd33e8663" title="Go to note 236.">236</a> at which time we went on bord to fetch the rest of our beere out of the ship, where
we found some of the barrels frozen in peeces, and the iron heapes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8668src" href="#xd33e8668" title="Go to note 237.">237</a> that were vpon the josam barrels<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8673src" href="#xd33e8673" title="Go to note 238.">238</a> were also frozen in peeces.
</p>
<p>The 21 of October it was calme sunshine wether, and then we had almost fetched all
our victuals out of the ship [to the house].
<span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 22 of October the wind blew coldly and very stiff north-east, with so great a
snow that we could not get out of our dores.
</p>
<p>The 23 of October it was calme weather, and the wind blew north-east. Then we went
aboord our ship to see if the rest of our men would come home to the house; but wee
feared y<sup>t</sup> it would blow hard againe, and therefore durst not stirre with the sicke man, but
let him ly still that day, for he was very weake.
</p>
<p>The 24 of October the rest of our men, being 8 persons, came to the house, and drew
the sicke man vpon a slead, and then with great labour and paine vve drew our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8689src" href="#xd33e8689" title="Go to note 239.">239</a> home to our house, and turned the bottome thereof vpwards, that when time serued
vs (if God saued our liues in the winter time) wee might vse it. And after that perceiuing
that the ship lay fast and that there was nothing lesse to be expected then the opening
of the water, we put our [kedge-]anchor into the ship againe, because it should not
be couered ouer and lost in the snow, that in the spring time<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8694src" href="#xd33e8694" title="Go to note 240.">240</a> we might vse it: for we alwaies trusted in God that hee would deliuer vs from thence
towards sommer time either one way or other.
</p>
<p>Things standing at this point with vs, as the sunne (when wee might see it best and
highest) began to be very low,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8701src" href="#xd33e8701" title="Go to note 241.">241</a> we vsed all the speede we could to fetch all things with sleades out of our ship
into our house, not onely meate and drinke but all other necessaries; at which time
the winde was north.
</p>
<p>The 26 of October we fetcht all things that were necessary for the furnishing of our
scute and our boate:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8709src" href="#xd33e8709" title="Go to note 242.">242</a> and when we had laden the last slead, and stood [in the track-ropes] ready to draw
it to the house, our maister looked about him and <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>saw three beares behind the ship that were comming towards vs, whereupon he cryed
out aloud to feare<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8714src" href="#xd33e8714" title="Go to note 243.">243</a> them away, and we presently leaped forth [from the track-ropes] to defend our selues
as well as we could. And as good fortune was, there lay two halberds vpon the slead,
whereof the master tooke one and I the other, and made resistance against them as
well as we could; but the rest of our men ran to saue themselues in the ship, and
as they ran one of them fell into a clift of ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8717src" href="#xd33e8717" title="Go to note 244.">244</a> which greeued vs much, for we thought verily that the beares would haue ran vnto
him to deuoure him; but God defended him, for the beares still made towards the ship
after the men y<sup>t</sup> ran thither to saue themselues. Meane time we and the man that fel into the clift
of ice tooke our aduantage, and got into the ship on the other side; which the beares
perceiuing, they came fiercely towards vs, that had no other armes to defend vs withall
but onely the two halberds, which wee doubting would not be sufficient, wee still
gaue them worke to do by throwing billets [of fire-wood] and other things at them,
and euery time we threw they ran after them, as a dogge vseth to doe at a stone that
is cast at him. Meane time we sent a man down vnder hatches<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8726src" href="#xd33e8726" title="Go to note 245.">245</a> [into the caboose] to strike fire, and another to fetch pikes; but wee could get
no fire, and so we had no meanes to shoote.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8731src" href="#xd33e8731" title="Go to note 246.">246</a> At the last, as the beares came fiercely vpon vs, we stroke one of them with a halberd
vpon the snoute, wherewith she gaue back when shee felt her selfe hurt, and went away,
which the other two y<sup>t</sup> were not so great as she perceiuing, ran away; and we thanked God that wee were so
well deliuered from them, and so drew our slead quietly to our house, and there shewed
our men what had happened vnto vs.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 26 of October the wind was north and north north-west, with indifferent faire
wether. Then we saw [much] open water hard by the land, but we perceiued the ice to
driue in the sea still towards the ship.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8740src" href="#xd33e8740" title="Go to note 247.">247</a>
</p>
<p>The 27 of October the wind blew north-east, and it snowed so fast that we could not
worke without the doore. That day our men kil’d a white fox, which they flead, and
after they had rosted it ate thereof, which tasted like connies<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8747src" href="#xd33e8747" title="Go to note 248.">248</a> flesh. The same day we set vp our diall and made the clock strike,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8750src" href="#xd33e8750" title="Go to note 249.">249</a> and we hung vp a lamp to burne in the night time, wherein we vsed the fat of the
beare, which we molt<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8755src" href="#xd33e8755" title="Go to note 250.">250</a> and burnt in the lampe.
</p>
<p>The 28 of October wee had the wind north-east, and then our men went out to fetch
wood; but there fell so stormy wether and so great a snow, that they were forced to
come home againe. About euening the wether began to breake vp,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8760src" href="#xd33e8760" title="Go to note 251.">251</a> at which time three of our men went to the place where we had set the beare vpright
and there stood frozen, thinking to pull out her teeth, but it was cleane couered
ouer with snow. And while they were there it began to snow so fast againe [with rough
weather], that they were glad to come home as fast as they could; but the snow beat
so sore vpon them that they could hardly see their way<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8765src" href="#xd33e8765" title="Go to note 252.">252</a> and had almost lost their right way, whereby they had like to haue laine all that
night out of the house [in the cold].
</p>
<p>The 29 of October the wind still blew north-east, and then we fetch’d segges<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8772src" href="#xd33e8772" title="Go to note 253.">253</a> from the sea side and laid them vpon the saile that was spread vpon our house, that
it might be so <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>much the closer and warmer: for the deales were not driuen close together, and the
foule wether would not permit vs to do it.
</p>
<p>The 30 of October the wind yet continued north-east, and the sunne was full aboue
the earth a little aboue the horizon.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8781src" href="#xd33e8781" title="Go to note 254.">254</a>
</p>
<p>The 31 of October the wind still blew north-east w<sup>t</sup> great store of snow, whereby we durst not looke out of doores.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8791src" href="#xd33e8791" title="Go to note 255.">255</a>
</p>
<p>The first of Nouember the wind still continued north-east, and then we saw the moone
rise in the east when it began to be darke, and the sunne was no higher aboue the
horizon than wee could well see it, and yet that day we saw it not, because of the
close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8798src" href="#xd33e8798" title="Go to note 256.">256</a> wether and the great snow that fell; and it was extreame cold, so that we could not
go out of the house.
</p>
<p>The 2 of November<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8805src" href="#xd33e8805" title="Go to note 257.">257</a> the wind blew west and somewhat south, but in the euening it blew north with calme
wether; and that day we saw the sunne rise south south-east, and it went downe [about]
south south-west, but it was not full aboue the earth,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8809src" href="#xd33e8809" title="Go to note 258.">258</a> but passed in the horizon along by the earth. And the same day one of our men killed
a fox with a hatchet, which was flead, rosted, and eaten. Before the sunne began to
decline wee saw no foxes, and then the beares vsed to go from vs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8814src" href="#xd33e8814" title="Go to note 259.">259</a>
</p>
<p>The 3 of Nouember the wind blew north-west w<sup>t</sup> calme wether, and the sunne rose south and by east and somewhat more southerly, and
went downe south and by west and <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>somewhat more southerly; and then we could see nothing but the upper part<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8826src" href="#xd33e8826" title="Go to note 260.">260</a> of the sun above the horizon, and yet the land where we were was as high as the mast<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8831src" href="#xd33e8831" title="Go to note 261.">261</a> of our ship.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8836src" href="#xd33e8836" title="Go to note 262.">262</a> Then we tooke the height of the sunne,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8840src" href="#xd33e8840" title="Go to note 263.">263</a> it being in the eleuenth degree and 41 minutes of<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8847src" href="#xd33e8847" title="Go to note 264.">264</a> Scorpio,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8851src" href="#xd33e8851" title="Go to note 265.">265</a> his declination being 15 degrees and 24 minutes on the south side of the equinoctiall
line.
</p>
<p>The 4 of Nouember it was calme wether, but then we saw the sunne no more, for it was
no longer aboue the horizon. Then our chirurgien<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8856src" href="#xd33e8856" title="Go to note 266.">266</a> [prescribed and] made a bath, to bathe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8861src" href="#xd33e8861" title="Go to note 267.">267</a> vs in, of a wine pipe, wherein we entred one after the other, and it did vs much
good and was a great meanes of our health. The same day we tooke a white fox, that
often times came abroad, not as they vsed at other times; for that when the beares
left vs at the setting of the sunne,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8872src" href="#xd33e8872" title="Go to note 268.">268</a> and came not againe before it rose,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8877src" href="#xd33e8877" title="Go to note 269.">269</a> the fox[es] to the contrary came abroad when they were gone.
</p>
<p>The 5 of Nouember the wind was north and somewhat west, and then we saw [much] open
water vpon the sea, but our ship lay still fast in the ice; and when the sunne had
left vs we saw y<sup>e</sup> moone continually both day and night, and [it] neuer went downe when it was in the
highest degree.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8888src" href="#xd33e8888" title="Go to note 270.">270</a>
</p>
<p>The 6 of Nouember the wind was north-west, still wether, <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>and then our men fetcht a slead full of fire-wood, but by reason that the son was
not seene it was very dark wether.
</p>
<p>The 7 of Nouember it was darke wether and very still, the wind west; at which time
we could hardly discerne the day from the night, specially because at that time our
clock stood still, and by that meanes we knew not when it was day although it was
day:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8897src" href="#xd33e8897" title="Go to note 271.">271</a> and our men rose not out of their cabens all that day<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8902src" href="#xd33e8902" title="Go to note 272.">272</a> but onely to make water, and therefore they knew not [very well] whether the light
they saw was the light of the day or of the moone, wherevpon they were of seueral
opinions, some saying it was the light of the day, the others of the night; but as
we tooke good regard therevnto, we found it to be the light of the day, about twelue
of the clock at noone.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8907src" href="#xd33e8907" title="Go to note 273.">273</a>
</p>
<p>The 8 of Nouember it was still wether, the wind blowing south and south-west. The
same day our men fetcht another slead of firewood, and then also we tooke a white
fox, and saw [much] open water in the sea. The same day we shared our bread amongst
vs, each man hauing foure pound and ten ounces<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8916src" href="#xd33e8916" title="Go to note 274.">274</a> for his allowance in eight daies; so that then we were eight daies eating a barrell
of bread, whereas before we ate it vp in fiue or sixe daies. [As yet] we had no need
to share our flesh and fish, for we had more store thereof; but our drinke failed
vs, and therefore we were forced to share that also: but our best beere was for the
most part wholly without any strength,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8921src" href="#xd33e8921" title="Go to note 275.">275</a> so that it had no sauour at all, and besides all this there was a great deale of
it spilt.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 9 of Nouember the wind blew north-east and somewhat more northerly, and then we
had not much day-light, but it was altogether darke.
</p>
<p>The 10 of Nouember it was calme wether, the wind north-west; and then our men went
into the ship to see how it lay, and wee saw that there was a great deale of water
in it, so that the balast was couered ouer with water, but it was frozen, and so might
not be pump’t out.
</p>
<p>The 11 of Nouember it was indifferent wether, the wind north-west. The same day we
made a round thing<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8931src" href="#xd33e8931" title="Go to note 276.">276</a> of cable yearn and [knitted] like to a net, [and set it] to catch foxes withall,
that we might get them into the house, and it was made like a trap, which fell vpon
the foxes as they came vnder it;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8936src" href="#xd33e8936" title="Go to note 277.">277</a> and that day we caught one.
</p>
<p>The 12 of Nouember the wind blew east, with a little<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8943src" href="#xd33e8943" title="Go to note 278.">278</a> light. That day we began to share our wine, euery man had two glasses<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8948src" href="#xd33e8948" title="Go to note 279.">279</a> a day, but commonly our drink was water which we molt<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8961src" href="#xd33e8961" title="Go to note 280.">280</a> out of snow which we gathered without the house.
</p>
<p>The 13 of Nouember it was foule wether, with great snow, the wind east.
</p>
<p>The 14 of Nouember it was faire cleare wether, with a cleare sky full of starres and
an east-wind.
</p>
<p>The 15 of November it was darke wether, the wind north-east, with a vading light.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8968src" href="#xd33e8968" title="Go to note 281.">281</a>
</p>
<p>The 16 of Nouember it was [still] wether, with a temperate aire<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8976src" href="#xd33e8976" title="Go to note 282.">282</a> and an east-wind.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 17 of Nouember it was darke wether and a close aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8984src" href="#xd33e8984" title="Go to note 283.">283</a> the wind east.
</p>
<p>The 18 of Nouember it was foule wether, the wind south-east. Then the maister cut
vp a packe of course [woollen] clothes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8991src" href="#xd33e8991" title="Go to note 284.">284</a> and divided it amongst the men that needed it, therewith to defend vs better from
the cold.
</p>
<p>The 19 of Nouember it was foule wether, with an east wind; and then the chest with
linnin was opened and deuided amongst the men for shift,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e8996src" href="#xd33e8996" title="Go to note 285.">285</a> for they had need of them, for then our onely care was to find all the means we could
to defend our body from the cold.
</p>
<p>The 20 of Nouember it was faire stil weather, the wind easterly. Then we washt our
sheets,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9003src" href="#xd33e9003" title="Go to note 286.">286</a> but it was so cold that when we had washt and wroong<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9008src" href="#xd33e9008" title="Go to note 287.">287</a> them, they presently froze so stiffe [out of the warm water], that, although we lay’d
them by a great fire, the side that lay next the fire thawed, but the other side was
hard frozen; so that we should sooner haue torne them in sunder<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9011src" href="#xd33e9011" title="Go to note 288.">288</a> than haue opened them, whereby we were forced to put them into the seething<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9016src" href="#xd33e9016" title="Go to note 289.">289</a> water again to thaw them, it was so exceeding cold.
</p>
<p>The 21 of Nouember it was indifferent<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9021src" href="#xd33e9021" title="Go to note 290.">290</a> wether with a north-east wind. Then wee agreed that euery man should take his turne
to cleaue wood, thereby to ease our cooke, that had more than work inough to doe twice
a day to dresse meat and to melt snowe for our drinke; but our master and the pilot<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9026src" href="#xd33e9026" title="Go to note 291.">291</a> were exempted from y<sup>t</sup> work.
</p>
<p>The 22 of Nouember the wind was <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: south-east">south-est</span>, [and] it was faire wether, then we had but<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9039src" href="#xd33e9039" title="Go to note 292.">292</a> seuenteene cheeses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9044src" href="#xd33e9044" title="Go to note 293.">293</a> whereof <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>one we ate <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: amongst">amonst</span> vs and the rest were deuided to euery man one for his portion, which they might eate
when he list.
</p>
<p>The 23 of Nouember it was indifferent good weather, the wind south-east, and as we
perceiued that the fox[es] vsed to come oftener and more than they were woont, to
take them the better we made certaine traps of thicke plancks, wheron we laid stones,
and round about them placed peeces of shards<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9058src" href="#xd33e9058" title="Go to note 294.">294</a> fast in the ground, that they might not dig vnder them; and so [we occasionally]
got some of the foxes.
</p>
<p>The 24 of Nouember it was foule wether, and the winde north-west,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9067src" href="#xd33e9067" title="Go to note 295.">295</a> and then we [again] prepared our selues to go into the bath, for some of vs were
not very well at ease; and so foure of vs went into it, and when we came out our surgion<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9071src" href="#xd33e9071" title="Go to note 296.">296</a> gave us a purgation, which did vs much good; and that day we took foure foxes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 25 of Nouember it was faire cleare wether, the winde west; and that day we tooke
two foxes with a springe that we had purposely set vp.
</p>
<p>The 26 of Nouember it was foule weather, and a great storme with a south-west wind
and great store of snowe, whereby we were so closed vp in the house that we could
not goe out, but were forced to ease ourselues within the house.
</p>
<p>The 27 of Nouember it was faire cleare weather, the wind south-west; and then we made
more springes to get foxs; for it stood vs vpon to doe it,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9126src" href="#xd33e9126" title="Go to note 297.">297</a> because they served vs for meat, as if God had sent them purposely for vs, for wee
had not much meate.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 28 of Nouember it was foule stormie weather, and the wind blew hard out of the
north, and it snew hard, whereby we were shut vp againe in our house, the snow lay
so closed before the doores.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9134src" href="#xd33e9134" title="Go to note 298.">298</a>
</p>
<p>The 29 of Nouember it was faire cleare wether and a good aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9141src" href="#xd33e9141" title="Go to note 299.">299</a> y<sup>e</sup> wind northerly; and we found meanes to open our doore by shoueling away the snowe,
whereby we got one of our dores open; and going out we found al our traps and springes
cleane<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9149src" href="#xd33e9149" title="Go to note 300.">300</a> couered ouer with snow, which we made cleane, and set them vp again to take foxes;
and that day we tooke one, which as then serued vs not onely for meat, but of the
skins we made caps to were<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9152src" href="#xd33e9152" title="Go to note 301.">301</a> vpon our heads, therewith to keep them warm from the extreame cold.
</p>
<p>The 30 of Nouember it was faire cleare weather, the wind west, and [when the watchers<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9157src" href="#xd33e9157" title="Go to note 302.">302</a> were about south-west, which according to our calculation was about midday,] sixe
of vs went to the ship, all wel prouided of arms, to see how it lay; and when we went
vnder the fore decke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9160src" href="#xd33e9160" title="Go to note 303.">303</a> we tooke a foxe aliue in the ship.
</p>
<p>The 1 of December it was foule weather, with a south-west wind and great stoare of
snow, whereby we were once againe stopt vp in the house, and by that meanes there
was so great a smoke in the house that we could hardly make fire, and so were forced
to lye all day in our cabens, but the cooke was forced to make fire to dresse our
meat.
</p>
<p>The 2 of December it was still foule weather, whereby we were forced to keep stil
in the house, and yet we could hardly sit by the fire because of the smoake, and therefore
stayed still [for the most part] in our cabens; and then we heated stones, which we
put into our cabens to warm our feet, for that both the cold and the smoke were vnsupportable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 3 of December we had the like weather, at which times as we lay in our cabans
we might heare the ice crack in the sea, and yet it was at the least halfe a mile
[two miles] from vs, which made a hugh noyse [of bursting and cracking], and we were
of oppinion that as then the great hils of ice<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9173src" href="#xd33e9173" title="Go to note 304.">304</a> which wee had seene in the sea in summer time [lying so many fathoms thick] brake
one from the other.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9176src" href="#xd33e9176" title="Go to note 305.">305</a> And for that during those 2 or 3 days, because of the extream smoake, we made not
so much fire as we commonly vsed to doe, it froze so sore within the house that the
wals and the roofe thereof were frozen two fingers thicke with ice, and also in our
cabans<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9181src" href="#xd33e9181" title="Go to note 306.">306</a> where we lay. All those three daies, while we could not go out by reason of the foule
weather, we set vp the [sand-]glas of 12 houres, and when it was run out we set it
vp againe, stil watching it lest we should misse our time. For the cold was so great
that our clock was frozen, and might<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9186src" href="#xd33e9186" title="Go to note 307.">307</a> not goe although we hung more waight on it then before.

<p>The 4 of December it was faire cleare weather, the wind north,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9197src" href="#xd33e9197" title="Go to note 308.">308</a> and then we began euery man by turne to dig open our dores that were closed vp with
snow; for we saw that it would be often to doe, and therefore we agreed to work by
turns, no man excepted but the maister and the pilot.
</p>
<p>The 5 of December it was faire weather with an east wind, and then we made our springes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9203src" href="#xd33e9203" title="Go to note 309.">309</a> cleane againe to take foxes.
</p>
<p>The 6 of December it was foule weather againe, with an easterly wind and extreame
cold, almost not to be indured; whereupon wee lookt pittifully one vpon the other,
being in great feare, that if the extremity of y<sup>e</sup> cold grew to be more and more we should all die there with cold, for that what <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>fire soeuer we made it would not warme vs: yea, and our sack,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9215src" href="#xd33e9215" title="Go to note 310.">310</a> which is so hotte,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9220src" href="#xd33e9220" title="Go to note 311.">311</a> was frozen very hard, so that when [at noon] we were euery man to haue his part,
we were forced to melt it in<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9225src" href="#xd33e9225" title="Go to note 312.">312</a> the fire, which we shared euery second day about halfe a pint for a man, wherewith
we were forced to sustain <span class="corr" id="xd33e9231" title="Source: onr">our</span> selues, and at other times we drank water, which agreed not well with the cold, and
we needed not to coole it with snowe or ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9234src" href="#xd33e9234" title="Go to note 313.">313</a> but we were forced to melt it out of the snow.
</p>
<p>The 7 of December it was still foule weather, and we had a great storme with a north-east
wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9240src" href="#xd33e9240" title="Go to note 314.">314</a> which brought an extreme cold with it; at which time we knew not what to do, and
while we sate consulting together what were best for vs to do, one of our companions
gaue vs counsell to burne some of the sea-coles<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9245src" href="#xd33e9245" title="Go to note 315.">315</a> that we had brought out of the ship, which would cast a great heat and continue long;
and so at euening we made a great fire thereof, which cast a great heat. At which
time we were very careful to keepe it in,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9250src" href="#xd33e9250" title="Go to note 316.">316</a> for that the heat being so great a comfort vnto vs, we tooke care how to make it
continue long; whereupon we agreed to stop vp all the doores and the chimney, thereby
to keepe in the heate, and so went into our cabans<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9255src" href="#xd33e9255" title="Go to note 317.">317</a> to sleepe, well comforted with the heat, and so lay a great while talking together;
but at last we were taken with a great swounding and daseling in our heads,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9258src" href="#xd33e9258" title="Go to note 318.">318</a> yet some more then other some, <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>which we first perceiued by a sick man and therefore the lesse able to beare it, and
found our selues to be very ill at ease, so that some of vs that were strongest start<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9266src" href="#xd33e9266" title="Go to note 319.">319</a> out of their cabans, and first opened the chimney and then the doores, but he that
opened the doore fell downe in a swound<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9269src" href="#xd33e9269" title="Go to note 320.">320</a> [with much groaning] vppon the snow; which I hearing, as lying in my caban<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9272src" href="#xd33e9272" title="Go to note 321.">321</a> next to the doore, start vp<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9275src" href="#xd33e9275" title="Go to note 322.">322</a> [and there saw him lying in a swoon], and casting vinegar in his face<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9280src" href="#xd33e9280" title="Go to note 323.">323</a> recouered him againe, and so he rose vp. And when the doores were open, we all recouered
our healthes againe by reason of the cold aire; and so the cold, which before had
beene so great an enemy vnto vs, was then the onely reliefe that we had, otherwise
without doubt we had [all] died in a sodaine swound.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9286src" href="#xd33e9286" title="Go to note 324.">324</a> After y<sup>t</sup>, the master, when we were come to our selues againe, gaue euery one of vs a little
wine to comfort our hearts.
</p>
<p>The 8 of December it was foule weather, the wind northerly, very sharpe and cold,
but we durst lay no more coles on as we did the day before, for that our misfortune
had taught vs that to shun one danger we should not run into an other [still greater].
</p>
<p>The 9 of December it was faire cleare weather, the skie full of starres; then we set
our doore wide open, which before was fast closed vp with snowe, and made our springes
ready to take foxes.
</p>
<p>The 10 of December it was still faire star-light weather, the wind north-west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9298src" href="#xd33e9298" title="Go to note 325.">325</a> Then we tooke two foxes, which were good meate for vs, for as then our victuals began
to be scant and the cold still increased, whereunto their skins serued vs for a good
defence.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 11 of December it was faire weather and a clear aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9305src" href="#xd33e9305" title="Go to note 326.">326</a> but very cold, which he that felt not would not beleeue, for our shoos<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9310src" href="#xd33e9310" title="Go to note 327.">327</a> froze as hard as hornes vpon our feet, and within they were white frozen, so that
we could not weare our shooes, but were forced to make great pattens,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9313src" href="#xd33e9313" title="Go to note 328.">328</a> y<sup>e</sup> vpper part being ship<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9321src" href="#xd33e9321" title="Go to note 329.">329</a> skins, which we put on ouer three or foure paire of socks, and so went in them to
keepe our feet warme.
</p>
<p>The 12 of December it was faire cleare weather, with [a bright sky and] a north-west
wind, but extreame cold, so that our house walles and cabans where<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9326src" href="#xd33e9326" title="Go to note 330.">330</a> frozen a finger thicke, yea and the clothes vpon our backs were white ouer with frost
[and icicles]; and although some of vs were of opinion that we should lay more coles
vpon the fire to warme vs, and that we should let the chimney stand open, yet we durst
not do it, fearing the like danger we had escaped.
</p>
<p>The 13 of December it was faire cleare wether, with an east wind. Then we tooke another
foxe, and took great paines about preparing and dressing of our springes, with no
small trouble, for that if we staied too long without the doores, there arose blisters<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9331src" href="#xd33e9331" title="Go to note 331.">331</a> vpon our faces and our eares.
</p>
<p>The 14 of December it was faire wether, the wind north-east and the sky full of starres.
Then we tooke the height of y<sup>e</sup> right shoulder of the <span class="corr" id="xd33e9341" title="Source: Rens">Reus</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9344src" href="#xd33e9344" title="Go to note 332.">332</a> when it was south south-west and somewhat more westerly (and then it was at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>highest in our [common] compas), and it was eleuated aboue the horison twenty degrees
and eighteen<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9371src" href="#xd33e9371" title="Go to note 333.">333</a> minutes, his declination being six degrees and eighteene minuts on the north side
of the lyne, which declination being taken out of the height aforesaid there rested
fourteen degrees, which being taken out of 90 degrees, then the height of y<sup>e</sup> Pole was seuenty sixe degrees.
</p>
<p>The 15 of December it was still faire [bright] weather, the wind east. That day we
tooke two foxes, and saw the moone rise east south-east, when it was twenty-sixe daies
old; [and it was] in the signe of Scorpio.
</p>
<p>The 16 of December it was faire cleare weather, the wind [north] east. At that time
we had no more wood in the house, but had burnt it all; but round about our house
there lay some couered ouer with snow, which with great paine and labour we were forced
to digge out and so shouell away the snow, and so brought it into the house, which
we did by turns, two and two together, wherein we were forced to vse great speede,
for we could not long endure without the house, because of the extreame cold,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9382src" href="#xd33e9382" title="Go to note 334.">334</a> although we ware<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9387src" href="#xd33e9387" title="Go to note 335.">335</a> the foxes skinnes about our heads and double apparell vpon our backs.
</p>
<p>The 17 of December the wind still held north-east, with faire weather, and so great
frosts that we were of opinion that if there stood a barrel full of water<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9392src" href="#xd33e9392" title="Go to note 336.">336</a> without the doore, it would in one night freeze from the top to the bottome.
</p>
<p>The 18 of December the wind still held north-east, with faire wether. Then seuen of
vs went out vnto the ship to see how it lay; and being vnder the decke, thinking to
find a foxe there, we sought all the holes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9400src" href="#xd33e9400" title="Go to note 337.">337</a> but we found none: but when we entered into the caben,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9407src" href="#xd33e9407" title="Go to note 338.">338</a> and had stricken fire to <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>see in what case the ship was and whether the water rose higher in it, there wee found
a fox, which we tooke and carried it home, and ate it, and then we found that in eighteene
dayes absence (for it was so long since we had beene there) the water was risen about
a finger high, but yet it was all ice, for it froze as fast as it came in, and the
vessels which we had brought with vs full of fresh water out of Holland were frozen
to the ground.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9414src" href="#xd33e9414" title="Go to note 339.">339</a>
</p>
<p>The 19 of December it was faire wether, the wind being south. Then we put each other
in good comfort that the sun was then almost half ouer and ready to come to vs againe,
which we sore longed for, it being a weary time for vs to be without the sunne, and
to want the greatest comfort that God sendeth vnto man here vpon the earth, and that
which reioiceth euery liuing thing.
</p>
<p>The 20 of Dece[mber] before noone it was faire cleare wether, and then we had taken
a fox; but towards euening there rose such a [violent] storm [and tempest] in the
south-west, with so great a snow, that all the house was inclosed therewith.
</p>
<p>The 21 of December it was faire cleere wether, with a north-east wind. Then we made
our doore cleane againe and made a way to go out, and clensed our traps for the foxes,
which did vs great pleasure when we tooke them, for they seemed as dainty as uenison
unto vs.
</p>
<p>The 22 of December it was foule wether with great store of snow, the wind south-west,
which stopt up our doore againe, and we were forced to dig it open againe, which was
almost euery day to do.
</p>
<p>The 23 of December it was foule wether, the wind south-west with great store of snow,
but we were in good comfort that the sunne would come againe to vs, for (as we gest<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9425src" href="#xd33e9425" title="Go to note 340.">340</a>) that day he was in Tropicus Capricorni, which is the furthest <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>signe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9430src" href="#xd33e9430" title="Go to note 341.">341</a> that the sunne passeth on the south side of the line, and from thence it turneth
north-ward againe. This Tropicus Capricorni lyeth on the south side of the equinoctial
line, in twenty-three degrees and twenty-eight<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9435src" href="#xd33e9435" title="Go to note 342.">342</a> minutes.
</p>
<p>The 24 of December, being Christmas-euen, it was faire wether. Then we opened our
doore againe and saw much open water in the sea: for we had heard the ice crack and
driue, [and] although it was not day,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9441src" href="#xd33e9441" title="Go to note 343.">343</a> yet we could see so farre. Towards euening it blew hard out of the north-east, with
great store of snow, so that all the passage that wee had made open before was [immediately]
stopt vp againe.
</p>
<p>The 25 of December, being Christmas day, it was foule wether with a north-west wind;
and yet, though it was [very] foule wether, we hard<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9448src" href="#xd33e9448" title="Go to note 344.">344</a> the foxes run ouer our house, wherewith some of our men said it was an ill signe;
and while we sate disputing why it should be an ill signe, some of our men made answere
that it was an ill signe because we could not take them, to put them into the pot
to rost them,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9451src" href="#xd33e9451" title="Go to note 345.">345</a> for that had been a very good signe for vs.
</p>
<p>The 26 of December it was foule wether, the wind north-west, and it was so [extraordinarily]
cold that we could not warme vs, although we vsed all the meanes we could, with greate
fires, good store of clothes, and with hot stones and billets<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9458src" href="#xd33e9458" title="Go to note 346.">346</a> laid vpon our feete and vpon our bodies as we lay in our cabens;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9463src" href="#xd33e9463" title="Go to note 347.">347</a> but notwithstanding all this, in the morning our cabens were frozen [white], which
made vs behold one the other with sad countenance. But yet we comforted our selues
againe as well as we could, that the sunne was then as low as it could goe, and that
it now began to come to vs againe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9466src" href="#xd33e9466" title="Go to note 348.">348</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>and we found it to be true; for that the daies beginning to lengthen the cold began
to strengthen, but hope put vs in good comfort and eased our paine.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9473src" href="#xd33e9473" title="Go to note 349.">349</a>
</p>
<p>The 27 of December it was still foule wether with a north-west wind, so that as then
we had not beene out in three daies together, nor durst not thrust our heads out of
doores; and within the house it was so extreme cold, that as we sate [close] before
a great fire, and seemed to burne<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9485src" href="#xd33e9485" title="Go to note 350.">350</a> [our shins] on the fore side, we froze behinde at our backs, and were al white, as
the country men<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9490src" href="#xd33e9490" title="Go to note 351.">351</a> vse to be when they come in at the gates of the towne in Holland with their sleads,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9495src" href="#xd33e9495" title="Go to note 352.">352</a> and haue gone<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9510src" href="#xd33e9510" title="Go to note 353.">353</a> all night.
</p>
<p>The 28 of December it was still foule wether, with a west wind, but about euening
it began to cleare vp. At which time one of our men made a hole open at one of our
doores, and went<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9517src" href="#xd33e9517" title="Go to note 354.">354</a> out to see what news abroad,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9522src" href="#xd33e9522" title="Go to note 355.">355</a> but found it so hard wether that he stayed not long, and told vs that it had snowed
so much that the snow lay higher than our house, and that if he had stayed out longer
his eares would undoubtedly haue been frozen off.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 29 of December it was calme wether and a pleasant aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9531src" href="#xd33e9531" title="Go to note 356.">356</a> the wind being southward. That day he whose turne it was opened the doore and dig’d
a hole through the snow, where wee went out of the house vpon steps as if it had bin
out of a seller,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9536src" href="#xd33e9536" title="Go to note 357.">357</a> at least seuen or eight steps high, each step a foote from the other. And then we
made cleane our springes [or traps] for the foxes, whereof for certain<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9539src" href="#xd33e9539" title="Go to note 358.">358</a> daies we had not taken any; and as we made them cleane, one of our men found a dead
fox in one of them that was frozen as hard as a stone, which he brought into the house
and thawed it before the fire, and after fleaing it some of our men ate it.
</p>
<p>The 30 of December it was foule wether againe, with a storme out of the west and great
store of snow, so that all the labour and paine that we had taken the day before,
to make steps to go out of our house and to clense our springes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9544src" href="#xd33e9544" title="Go to note 359.">359</a> was al in vaine; for it was al couered over w<sup>t</sup> snow againe higher then it was before.
</p>
<p>The 31 of December it was still foule wether with a storme out of the north-west,
whereby we were so fast shut vp into the house as if we had beene prisoners, and it
was so extreame cold that the fire almost cast no heate; for as we put our feete to
the fire, we burnt our hose<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9554src" href="#xd33e9554" title="Go to note 360.">360</a> before we could feele the heate, so that we had [constantly] work inough to do to
patch our hose. And, which is more, if we had not sooner smelt then felt them, we
should haue burnt them [quite away] ere we had knowne it.
</p>
<p>[Anno 1597]
</p>
<p>After that, with great cold, danger, and disease,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9560src" href="#xd33e9560" title="Go to note 361.">361</a> we had brought the<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9565src" href="#xd33e9565" title="Go to note 362.">362</a> yeare vnto an end, we entered into y<sup>e</sup> yeare of our Lord God 1597, y<sup>e</sup> beginning whereof was in y<sup>e</sup> same maner as y<sup>e</sup> end of anno 1596 had been; for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>wether continued as cold, foule, [boisterous], and snowy as it was before, so that
vpon the first of January we were inclosed in the house, y<sup>e</sup> wind then being west. At the same time we agreed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9587src" href="#xd33e9587" title="Go to note 363.">363</a> to share our wine euery man a small measure full, and that but once in two daies.
And as we were in great care and feare that it would [still] be long before we should
get out from thence, and we [sometimes] hauing but smal hope therein, some of vs spared
to drink wine as long as wee could, that if we should stay long there we might drinke
it at our neede.
</p>
<p>The 2 of January it blew hard, with a west wind and a great storme, with both snow
and frost, so that in four or five daies we durst not put our heads out of y<sup>e</sup> doores; and as then by reason of the great cold we had almost burnt all our wood
[that was in the house], notwithstanding we durst not goe out to fetch more wood,
because it froze so hard and there was no being without the doore; but seeking about
we found some [superfluous] pieces of wood that lay ouer the doore, which we [broke
off and] cloue, and withall cloue the blocks<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9597src" href="#xd33e9597" title="Go to note 364.">364</a> whereon we vsed to beate our stock-fish,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9602src" href="#xd33e9602" title="Go to note 365.">365</a> and so holp our selues so well as we could.
</p>
<p>The 3 of January it was all one weather [constantly boisterous, with snow and a north-west
wind, and so exceedingly cold that we were forced to remain close shut up in the house],
and we had little wood to burne.
</p>
<p>The 4 of January it was still foule stormie weather, with much snow and great cold,
the wind south-west, and we were forced to keepe [constantly shut up] in the house.
And to know where the wind blew, we thrust a halfe pike out at y<sup>e</sup> chimney w<sup>t</sup> a little cloth or fether upon it; but [we had to look at it immediately the wind
caught it, for] as soone as we thrust it out it was presently frozen as hard as a
peece of <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>wood, and could not go about nor stirre with the wind [so that we said to one another
how tremendously cold it must be out of doors].
</p>
<p>The 5 of January it was somewhat still and calme weather.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9620src" href="#xd33e9620" title="Go to note 366.">366</a> Then we digd our doore open againe, that we might goe out and carry out all the filth
that had bin made during the time of our being shut in the house, and made euery thing
handsome, and fetched in wood, which we cleft; and it was all our dayes worke to further
our selues as much as we could, fearing lest we should be shut up againe. And as there
were three doores in our portall, and for y<sup>t</sup> our house lay couered ouer in snow, we took y<sup>e</sup> middle doore thereof away, and digged a great hole in the snow that laie without
the house, like to a side of a vault,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9631src" href="#xd33e9631" title="Go to note 367.">367</a> wherein we might go to ease our selues and cast other filth into it. And when we
had taken paines<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9636src" href="#xd33e9636" title="Go to note 368.">368</a> al day, we remembered our selues that it was Twelf Even,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9642src" href="#xd33e9642" title="Go to note 369.">369</a> and then we prayed our maister<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9655src" href="#xd33e9655" title="Go to note 370.">370</a> that [in the midst of all our troubles] we might be merry that night, and said that
we were content to spend some of the wine that night which we had spared and which
was our share euery second day, and whereof for certaine daies we had not drunke;
and so that night we made merry and drunke to the three kings.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9660src" href="#xd33e9660" title="Go to note 371.">371</a> And <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>therewith we had two pound of meale [which we had taken to make paste for the cartridges],
whereof we [now] made pancakes with oyle, and [we laid to] euery man a white bisket<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9669src" href="#xd33e9669" title="Go to note 372.">372</a> which we sopt in [the] wine. And so supposing that we were<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9674src" href="#xd33e9674" title="Go to note 373.">373</a> in our owne country and amongst our frends, it comforted vs as well as if we had
made a great banket<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9678src" href="#xd33e9678" title="Go to note 374.">374</a> in our owne house. And we also made<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9681src" href="#xd33e9681" title="Go to note 375.">375</a> tickets, and our gunner was king of Noua Zembla, which is at least two hundred [800]
miles long<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9686src" href="#xd33e9686" title="Go to note 376.">376</a> and lyeth betweene two seas.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9689src" href="#xd33e9689" title="Go to note 377.">377</a>
</p>
<p>The 6 of January it was faire weather, the wind north-east. Then we went out and clensed
our traps [and springes] to take foxes, which were our uenison; and we digd a great
hole in the snow where our fire-wood lay, and left it close aboue like a vault [of
a cellar], and from thence fetcht out our wood as we needed it.
</p>
<p>The 7 of January it was foule weather againe, with a north-west wind and some snow,
and very cold, which put vs in great feare to be shut up in the house againe.

<p>The 8 of January it was faire weather againe, the wind north. Then we made our [traps
and] springes ready to get more uenison, which we longed for. And then we might [sometimes
begin to] see and marke day-light, which then began to increase, that the sunne as
then began to come towards vs againe, which thought put vs in no litle comfort.
</p>
<p>The 9 of January it was foule wether, with a north-west wind, but not so hard wether
as it had bin before, so y<sup>t</sup> we might<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9701src" href="#xd33e9701" title="Go to note 378.">378</a> go out of the doore to make cleane our springes; but it was no need to bid vs go
home againe, for the cold taught <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>vs by experience not to stay long out, for it was not so warm to get any good by staying
in the aire.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9706src" href="#xd33e9706" title="Go to note 379.">379</a>
</p>
<p>The 10 of January it was faire weather, with a north wind. Then seuen of vs went to
our ship, well armed, which we found in the same state we left it in, and [in] it
we saw many footsteps of beares, both great and small, whereby it seemed that there
had bin more than one or two beares therein. And as we went under hatches, we strooke
fire and lighted a candle, and found that the water was rysen a foote higher in the
ship.
</p>
<p>The 11 of January it was faire weather, the wind north-west<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9714src" href="#xd33e9714" title="Go to note 380.">380</a> and the cold began to be somewhat lesse, so that as then we were bold to goe [now
and then] out of the doores, and went about a quarter of a mile [one mile] to a hill,
from whence we fetched certaine stones, which we layd in the fire, therewith to warme
vs in our cabans.
</p>
<p>The 12 of January it was faire cleare weather, the wind west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9720src" href="#xd33e9720" title="Go to note 381.">381</a> That euening it was very cleare, and the skie full of stars. Then we tooke the height
of Occulus Tauri,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9724src" href="#xd33e9724" title="Go to note 382.">382</a> which <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>is a bright and well knowne star, and we found it to be eleuated aboue y<sup>e</sup> horison twenty nine degrees and fifty foure minutes, her declination being fifteene
degrees fifty foure minutes on the north side of the lyne. This declination being
substracted from the height aforesaid, then there rested fourteene degrees; which
substracted from ninety degrees, then the height of the pole was seuenty sixe degrees.
And so by measuring the height of that starre and some others, we gest that y<sup>e</sup> sun was in the like height,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9758src" href="#xd33e9758" title="Go to note 383.">383</a> and that we were there vnder seuenty sixe degrees, and rather higher than lower.
</p>
<p>The 13 of January it was faire still weather, the wind westerlie; and then we perceaued
that daylight began more and more to increase, and wee went out and cast bullets at
the bale of y<sup>e</sup> flag staffe, which before we could not see when it turnd about.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9770src" href="#xd33e9770" title="Go to note 384.">384</a>
</p>
<p>The 14 of January it was faire weather and a cleare light,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9779src" href="#xd33e9779" title="Go to note 385.">385</a> the wind westerlie; and that day we tooke a fox.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9784src" href="#xd33e9784" title="Go to note 386.">386</a>
</p>
<p>The 15 of January it was faire cleare weather, with a west wind; and six of vs went
aboord the ship, where we found the bolck-vanger,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9791src" href="#xd33e9791" title="Go to note 387.">387</a> which the last time that we were in the ship we stucke in a hole in the fore decke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9796src" href="#xd33e9796" title="Go to note 388.">388</a> to take foxes, puld out of the hole, and lay in the middle of the ship, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>al torne in peeces by the bears, as we perceiued by their foote-steps.
</p>
<p>The 16 of January it was faire weather, the wind northerly; and then we went now and
then out of the house to strech out our ioynts and our limbs with going and running,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9805src" href="#xd33e9805" title="Go to note 389.">389</a> that we might not become lame; and about noone time we saw a certaine rednes in the
skie, as a shew or messenger of the sunne that began to come towards vs.
</p>
<p>The 17 of January it was cleare weather, with a north wind, and then still more and
more we perceiued that the sun began to come neerer vnto vs; for the day was somewhat
warmer, so that when wee had a good fire there fell great peeces of ice downe from
the walles [and roof] of our house, and the ice melted in our cabens and the water
dropt downe, which was not so before how great soeuer our fire was; but that night
it was colde againe.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9814src" href="#xd33e9814" title="Go to note 390.">390</a>
</p>
<p>The 18 of January it was faire cleare weather with a south-east wind. Then our wood
began to consume,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9821src" href="#xd33e9821" title="Go to note 391.">391</a> and so we agreed to burne some of our sea-coles, and not to stop up the chimney,
and then wee should not neede to feare any hurt,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9826src" href="#xd33e9826" title="Go to note 392.">392</a> which wee did, and found no disease thereby; but we thought it better for vs to keepe
the coles and to burne our wood more sparingly, for that the coles would serue vs
better when we should saile home in our open scute.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9831src" href="#xd33e9831" title="Go to note 393.">393</a><span id="xd33e9835"></span>
</p>
<p>The 19 of January it was faire weather, with a north wind. And then our bread began
to diminish, for that some of our barels were not full waight, and so the diuision
was lesse, and we were forced to mak our allowance bigger with <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>that which we had spared before. And then some of vs went abord the ship, wherein
there was halfe a barrell of bread, which we thought to spare till the last, and there
[quite] secretly each of them tooke a bisket or two out of it.
</p>
<p>The 20 of January the ayre was cleare,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9844src" href="#xd33e9844" title="Go to note 394.">394</a> and the wind south-west. That day we staied in the house and cloue wood to burne,
and brake some of our emptie barrels, and cast the iron hoopes vpon the top of the
house.
</p>
<p>The 21 of January it was faire [clear] weather, with a west wind. At that time taking
of foxes began to faile vs, which was a signe that the beares would soone come againe,
as not long after we found it to be true; for as long as the beares stay[ed] away
the foxes came abroad, and not much before the beares came abroad the foxes were but
little seene.
</p>
<p>The 22 of January it was faire wether with a west wind. Then we went out againe to
cast the bullet,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9852src" href="#xd33e9852" title="Go to note 395.">395</a> and perceiued that day light began to appeare, whereby some of vs said that the sun
would soon appeare vnto vs, but William Barents to the contrary said that it was yet
[more than] two weeks too soone.
</p>
<p>The 23 of January it was faire calme weather, with a south-west wind. Then foure of
vs went to the ship and comforted each other, giuing God thankes that the hardest
time of the winter was past, being in good hope that we should liue to talke of those
things at home in our owne country; and when we were in the ship we found that the
water rose higher and higher in it, and so each of us taking a bisket or two with
us, we went home againe.
</p>
<p>The 24 of January it was faire cleare weather, with a west wind. Then I and Jacob
Hermskercke, and another with vs, went to the sea-side on the south side of Noua Zembla,
where, contrary to our expectation, I [the] first [of all]<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9860src" href="#xd33e9860" title="Go to note 396.">396</a> saw the <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>edge of the sun;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9865src" href="#xd33e9865" title="Go to note 397.">397</a> wherewith we went speedily home againe, to tell William Barents and the rest of our
companions that joyfull newes. But William Barents, being a wise and well experienced
pilot, would not beleeve it, esteeming it to be about fourteene daies too soone for
the sunne to shin in that part of the world;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9868src" href="#xd33e9868" title="Go to note 398.">398</a> but we earnestly affirmed the contrary and said we had seene the sunne [whereupon
divers wagers were laid].
</p>
<p>The 20 and 26 of January it was misty and close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9875src" href="#xd33e9875" title="Go to note 399.">399</a> weather, so y<sup>t</sup> we could not see anything. Then they that layd y<sup>e</sup> contrary wager w<sup>t</sup> vs, thought that they had woon; but vpon the twenty seuen day it was cleare [and
bright] weather, and then <span class="marginnote">How the sun which they had lost the 4 of Nouember did appere to them again vpon the
24 of January, which was very strange, and contrary to al learned mens opinions.</span> we [all] saw the sunne in his full roundnesse aboue the horison, whereby it manifestly
appeared that we had seene it vpon the twenty foure day of January. And as we were
of diuers opinions touching the same, and that we said it was cleane contrary to the
opinions of all olde and newe writers, yea and contrary to the nature and roundnesse
both of heauen and earth; some of vs said, that seeing in long time there had been
no day, that it might be that we had ouerslept our selues, whereof we were better
assured:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9893src" href="#xd33e9893" title="Go to note 400.">400</a> but concerning the thing in itselfe, seeing God is wonderfull in all his workes,
we wille referre that to his almightie power, and leaue it vnto others to dispute
of. But for that no man shall thinke vs to be in doubt thereof, if we should let this
passe without discoursing vpon it, therefore we will make some declaration thereof,
whereby we may assure our selues that we kept good reckening.
</p>
<p>You must vnderstand, that when we first saw the sunne, <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>it was in the fift degree and 25 minutes of Aquarius,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9902src" href="#xd33e9902" title="Go to note 401.">401</a> and it should haue staied, according to our first gessing,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9932src" href="#xd33e9932" title="Go to note 402.">402</a> till it had entred into the sixteenth degree and 27 minutes of Aquarius<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9937src" href="#xd33e9937" title="Go to note 403.">403</a> before he should haue shewed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9955src" href="#xd33e9955" title="Go to note 404.">404</a> there vnto vs in the high of 76 degrees.
</p>
<p>Which we striuing and contending about it amongst our selues, we could not be satisfied,
but wondred thereat, and amongst vs were of oppinion that we had mistaken our selues,
which neuerthelesse we could [not] be persuaded vnto, for that euery day without faile
we noted what had past, and also had vsed our clocke continually, and when that was
frosen we vsed our houre-glasse of 12 houres long. Whereupon we argued with our selues
in diuers wise, to know how we should finde out that difference, and learne<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9960src" href="#xd33e9960" title="Go to note 405.">405</a> the truth of the time; which to trie we agreed to looke into the Ephemerides made
by Josephus Schala,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9964src" href="#xd33e9964" title="Go to note 406.">406</a> printed in Venice, for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>yeeres of our Lord 1589 till <span class="sc">A.</span> 1600, and we found therein that vpon the 24 day of January, (when the sunne first
appeared vnto vs) that at Venice, the clocke being one in the night time,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9981src" href="#xd33e9981" title="Go to note 407.">407</a> the moone and Jupiter were in coniunction.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e9985src" href="#xd33e9985" title="Go to note 408.">408</a> Whereupon we sought to knowe when the same coniunction should be ouer or about the
house where we then were; and at last we found, y<sup>t</sup> the 24 day of January was the same day whereon the coniunction aforesaid happened
in Venice, at one of the clocke in the night, and with vs in the morning when y<sup>e</sup> sun was in the east:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10072src" href="#xd33e10072" title="Go to note 409.">409</a> for we saw manifestly that the two <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>planets aforesaid aproached neere vnto each other,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10077src" href="#xd33e10077" title="Go to note 410.">410</a> vntill such time as the moone and Jupiter stood iust ouer the other,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10083src" href="#xd33e10083" title="Go to note 411.">411</a> both in the signe of Taurus,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10097src" href="#xd33e10097" title="Go to note 412.">412</a> and that was at six of the clocke in the morning;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10106src" href="#xd33e10106" title="Go to note 413.">413</a> at which time the moone and Jupiter were found by our compas to be in coniunction,
ouer our house, in the north and by east point, and the south part of the compass
was south-south-west, and there we had it right south,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10109src" href="#xd33e10109" title="Go to note 414.">414</a> the moone being eight daies old; whereby it appeareth <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>that the sunne and the moone were eight points different,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10164src" href="#xd33e10164" title="Go to note 415.">415</a> and this was about sixe of the clocke in the morning:<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10168src" href="#xd33e10168" title="Go to note 416.">416</a> this place differeth from Venice fiue houres in longitude, whereby we maye gesse<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10199src" href="#xd33e10199" title="Go to note 417.">417</a> how much we were nearer east<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10204src" href="#xd33e10204" title="Go to note 418.">418</a> then the citie of Venice, which was fiue houres, each houre being 15 degrees, which
is in all 75 degrees that we were more easterly then Venice. By all which it is manifestly
to be seene that we had not failed in our account, and that also we had found our
right longitude by the two planets aforesaid; for the towne of Venice lieth vnder
37 degrees and 25 minutes in longitude, and her declination<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10209src" href="#xd33e10209" title="Go to note 419.">419</a> is 46 degrees and 5 minutes;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10212src" href="#xd33e10212" title="Go to note 420.">420</a> whereby it followeth that our place of Noua Zembla lieth vnder 112 degrees and 25
minutes in longitude, and the high of the Pole 76 degrees; and so you haue the right
longitude and latitude. But from <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>the vttermost [east] point of Noua Zembla to <span class="corr" id="xd33e10218" title="Source: ye">y<sup>e</sup></span> point of Cape de Tabin,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10228src" href="#xd33e10228" title="Go to note 421.">421</a> the vttermost point of Tartaria, where it windeth southward, the longitude differeth
60 degrees.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10233src" href="#xd33e10233" title="Go to note 422.">422</a> But you must vnderstand that the degrees are not so great as they are vnder the equinoxial
line; for right vnder the line a degree is fifteene [60] miles; but when you leaue
the line, either northward or southward, then the degrees in longitude do lessen,
so that the neerer that a man is to the north or south Pole, so much the degrees are
lesse: so that vnder the 76 degrees northward, where wee wintered, the degrees are
but 3 miles and ⅔ parts [14⅔ miles],<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10236src" href="#xd33e10236" title="Go to note 423.">423</a> whereby it is to be marked<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10245src" href="#xd33e10245" title="Go to note 424.">424</a> that we had but 60 degrees to saile to the said Cape de Tabin, which is 220 [880]
miles, so<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10250src" href="#xd33e10250" title="Go to note 425.">425</a> the said cape lieth in 172 degrees in longitude as it is thought: and being aboue
it,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10258src" href="#xd33e10258" title="Go to note 426.">426</a> it seemeth that we should be in the straight of Anian,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10263src" href="#xd33e10263" title="Go to note 427.">427</a> where we may saile bouldlie into the south, as the land <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>reacheth. Now what further instructions are to be had to know where we lost the sun<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10277src" href="#xd33e10277" title="Go to note 428.">428</a> vnder y<sup>e</sup> said 76 degrees upon the fourth of Nouember, and saw it again vpon the 24 of January,
I leaue that to be described<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10285src" href="#xd33e10285" title="Go to note 429.">429</a> by such as make profession thereof: it suffiseth vs to haue shewed that it failed
vs not to appeare at the ordinary time.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10291src" href="#xd33e10291" title="Go to note 430.">430</a>
</p>
<p>The 25 of January it was darke clowdy weather, the wind westerlie, so that the seeing
of the sunne the day before was againe doubted of; and then many wagers were laid,
and we still lookt out to see if the sunne appeared. The same day we sawe a beare
(which as long as the sunne appeared not vnto vs we sawe not) comming out of the southwest
towards our house; but when we shouted at her she came no neerer, but went away againe.
</p>
<p>The 26 of Janurie it was faire cleere weather, but in the horrison there hung a white
or darke cloude,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10299src" href="#xd33e10299" title="Go to note 431.">431</a> whereby we could not see the sun; whereupon the rest of our companions thought that
we had mistaken our selues upon the 24 day, and that the sunne appeared not vnto vs,
and mocked vs; but we were resolute in our former affirmation that we had seene the
sunne, but not in the full roundnesse. That euening the sicke man that was amongst
vs was very weake, and felt himselfe to be extreame sick, for he had laine long time,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10304src" href="#xd33e10304" title="Go to note 432.">432</a> and we comforted him as well as we might, and gaue him the best admonition y<sup>t</sup> we could,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10312src" href="#xd33e10312" title="Go to note 433.">433</a> but he died not long after midnight.
</p>
<p>The 27 of Januarie it was faire cleere weather, with a <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>south-west winde: then in the morning we digd a hole in the snowe, hard by the house,
but it was still so extreame cold that we could not stay long at worke, and so we
digd by turnes euery man a litle while, and then went to the fire, and an other went
and supplyed his place, till at last we digd seauen foote depth, where we went to
burie the dead man; after that, when we had read certaine chapters and sung some psalmes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10322src" href="#xd33e10322" title="Go to note 434.">434</a> we all went out and buried the man; which done, we went in and brake our fasts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10327src" href="#xd33e10327" title="Go to note 435.">435</a> And while we were at meate, and discoursed amongst our selues touching the great
quantitie of snowe that continually fell in that place, wee said that if it fell out
that our house should be closed vp againe with snowe, we would find the meanes to
climbe out at the chimney; whereupon our master<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10332src" href="#xd33e10332" title="Go to note 436.">436</a> went to trie if he could clime vp through the chimney and so get out, and while he
was climbing one of our men went forth of the doore to see if the master were out
or not, who, standing vpon the snowe, sawe the sunne, and called vs all out, wherewith
we all went forth and saw the sunne in his full roundnesse a litle aboue the horrison,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10335src" href="#xd33e10335" title="Go to note 437.">437</a> and then it was without all doubt that we had seene the sunne vpon the 24 of Januarie,
which made vs all glad, and we gaue God hearty thankes for his grace shewed vnto us,
that that glorious light appeared vnto vs againe.
</p>
<p>The 28 of January it was faire [clear] weather, with a west wind; then we went out
many tymes to exercise our selues, by going, running, casting of the ball (for then
we <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>might see a good way from vs), and to refresh our ioynts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10345src" href="#xd33e10345" title="Go to note 438.">438</a> for we had long time sitten dull,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10350src" href="#xd33e10350" title="Go to note 439.">439</a> whereby many of vs were very loase.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10355src" href="#xd33e10355" title="Go to note 440.">440</a>
</p>
<p>The 29 of January it was foule weather, with great store of snow, the wind north-west,
whereby the house was closed vp againe with snow.
</p>
<p>The 30 of January it was darke weather, with an east-wind, and we made a hole through
the doore, but we shoueled not the snow very farre from the portaile,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10393src" href="#xd33e10393" title="Go to note 441.">441</a> for that as soone as we saw what weather it was, we had no desire to goe abroad.
</p>
<p>The 31 of January it was faire calme weather, with an east-wind; then we made the
doore cleane, and shoueled away the snow, and threw it vpon the house, and went out
and saw<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10400src" href="#xd33e10400" title="Go to note 442.">442</a> the sunne shine cleare, which comforted vs; meane time we saw a beare, that came
towards our house, but we went softly in and watcht for her till she came neerer,
and as soone she was hard by we shot at her, but she ran away againe.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 1 of February, being Candlemas eve, it was boisterous weather with a great storme
and good store of snow, whereby the house was closed vp againe with snow, and we were
constrained to stay within dores; the wind then being north-west.
</p>
<p>The 2 of February it was [still the same] foule weather, and as then the sun had not
rid vs of all the foule weather, whereby we were some what discomforted, for that
being in good hope of better weather we had not made so great prouision of wood as
wee did before.
</p>
<p>The 3 of February it was faire weather with an east winde, but very misty, whereby
we could not see the sun, which made vs somewhat melancholy to see so great a miste,
and rather more then we had had in the winter time; and then we digd our doore open
againe and fetcht the wood that lay without about the dore into the house, which we
were forced with great paine and labour to dig out of the snow.
</p>
<p>The 4 of February it was [again] foule weather with great store of snow, the wind
being south-west, and then we were close up again with snow; but then we tooke not
so much paines as we did before to dig open the doore, but when we had occasion to
goe out we clome<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10409src" href="#xd33e10409" title="Go to note 443.">443</a> out at the chimney and eased our selues, and went in againe the same way.
</p>
<p>The 5 of February it was still foule weather, the wind being east with great store
of snow, whereby we were shut vp againe into the house and had no other way to get
out but by the chimney, and those that could not clime out were faine to helpe themselues
within as well as they could.
</p>
<p>The 6 of February it was still foule stormie weather with store of snow, and we still
went out at the chimney, and troubled not ovr selues with the doore, for some of vs
made it an easie matter to clime out at the chimney.
</p>
<p>The 7 of February it was still foule weather with much snow and a south-west wind,
and we thereby forced to <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>keepe the house, which griued<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10419src" href="#xd33e10419" title="Go to note 444.">444</a> vs more than when the sun shined not, for that hauing seen it and felt the heat thereof,
yet we were forced not to inioy<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10422src" href="#xd33e10422" title="Go to note 445.">445</a> it.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 8 of February it began to be fairer weather, [the sky being bright and clear,
and] the wind being south-west; then we saw the sun rise south south-east and went
downe south south-west;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10431src" href="#xd33e10431" title="Go to note 446.">446</a> [well understood] by y<sup>e</sup> compas that we had made of lead and placed to the right meridian of that place, but
by our common compas according<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10437src" href="#xd33e10437" title="Go to note 447.">447</a> it differed two points.
</p>
<p>The 9 of February it was faire cleare weather, the wind south-west, but as then we
could not see the sunne, because it was close weather in the south, where the sunne
should goe downe.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10442src" href="#xd33e10442" title="Go to note 448.">448</a>
</p>
<p>The 10 of February it was faire cleare weather [and calm], so that we could not tell
where the wind blew, and then we began to feele some heat of the sunne; but in the
euening it began to blow somewhat cold<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10451src" href="#xd33e10451" title="Go to note 449.">449</a> out of the west.
</p>
<p>The 11 of February it was faire weather, the wind south; y<sup>t</sup> day about noone there came a beare towards our house, and we watcht her with our
muskets, but she came not so neere that wee could reach her. The same night we heard
some foxes stirring, which since the beares began to come abroad againe we had [not]
much seen.
</p>
<p>The 12 of February it was cleare weather and very calme, the wind south-west. Then
we made our traps [and springes] cleane againe; meane-time there came a great beare
towards our house, which made vs all goe in, and we leauelled at her with our muskets,
and as she came right before our dore we shot her into the breast clean through the
heart, the bullet <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>passing through her body and went out againe at her tayle, and was as flat as a counter<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10465src" href="#xd33e10465" title="Go to note 450.">450</a> [that has been beaten out with a hammer]. The beare feeling the blow, lept backwards,
and ran twenty or thirty foote from the house, and there lay downe, wherewith we lept
all out of the house and ran to her, and found her stil aliue; and when she saw vs
she reard vp her head, as if she would gladly haue doone vs some mischefe;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10470src" href="#xd33e10470" title="Go to note 451.">451</a> but we trusted her not, for that we had tryed her strength sufficiently before, and
therefore we shot her<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10475src" href="#xd33e10475" title="Go to note 452.">452</a> twice into the body againe, and therewith she dyed. Then we ript vp her belly, and
taking out her guts, drew her home to the house, where we flead her and tooke at least
one hundred pound of fat out of her belly, which we molt<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10479src" href="#xd33e10479" title="Go to note 453.">453</a> and burnt in our lampe. This grease did vs great good seruice, for by that meanes
we still kept a lampe burning all night long, which before we could not doe for want
of grease; and [further] euery man had meanes to burne a lamp in his caban for such
necessaries as he had to doe. The beares skin was nine foote long and 7 foote broad.
</p>
<p>The 13 of February it was faire cleare weather with a hard west wind, at which time
we had more light in our house by burning of lamps, whereby we had meanes to passe
the time away by reading and other exercises, which before (when we could not distinguish
day from night by reason of the darknesse, and had not lamps continually burning)
we could not doe.
</p>
<p>The 14th of February it was faire cleere weather with a hard west wind before noone,
but after noone it was still weather. Then fiue of vs went to the ship to see how
it laie, and found the water to encrease in it, but not much.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 15 of February it was foule weather, with a great storme out of the south-west,
with great store of snowe, whereby the house was closed vp againe. That night the
foxes came to deuoure the dead body of the beare, whereby we were in great feare that
all the beares thereabouts would come theather,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10488src" href="#xd33e10488" title="Go to note 454.">454</a> and therefore we agreed, as soone as we could, to get out of the house, to bury the
dead beare deepe vnder the snowe.
</p>
<p>The 16 of February it was still foule weather, with great store of snow and a south-west
wind. That day was Shroue Twesday;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10493src" href="#xd33e10493" title="Go to note 455.">455</a> then wee made our selues some what merry in our great griefe and trouble, and euery
one of vs dranke a draught of wine in remembrance that winter began to weare away,
and faire weather<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10511src" href="#xd33e10511" title="Go to note 456.">456</a> to aproache.
</p>
<p>The 17 of February it was still foule weather and a darke sky, the wind south. Then
we opened our dore againe and swept away the snow, and then we thrue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10521src" href="#xd33e10521" title="Go to note 457.">457</a> the dead beare into the hoale where we had digd out some wood, and stopt it vp, that
the beares by smelling it should not come thither to trouble vs, and we set vp our
springs<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10524src" href="#xd33e10524" title="Go to note 458.">458</a> againe to take foxes; and the same day fiue of us went to the ship to see how it
laie, which we found all after one sort;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10527src" href="#xd33e10527" title="Go to note 459.">459</a> there we found foote-steps of many beares, as though they had taken it vp for their
lodging when we had forsaken it.
</p>
<p>The 18 of February it was foule weather with much snow and very cold, the wind being
south-west; and in the night <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>time, as we burnt lampes and some of our men laie [late] awake, we heard beasts runne
vpon the roofe of our house, which by reason of the snowe made the noise of their
feete sound more than otherwise it would haue done, the snow was so hard [and cracked
so much that it gave a great sound], whereby we thought they had beene beares; but
when it was day we sawe no footing but of foxes, and we thought they had beene beares,
for the night, which of it selfe is solitarie and fearefull, made that which was doubtfull
to be more doubtfull and worse feared.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10534src" href="#xd33e10534" title="Go to note 460.">460</a>
</p>
<p>The 19 of February it was faire cleere weather with a south-west wind. Then we tooke
the hight of the sunne, which in long time before we could not doe because the horizon
was not cleere, as also for that it mounted not so high nor gaue not so much shadowe
as we were to haue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10541src" href="#xd33e10541" title="Go to note 461.">461</a> in our astrolabium, and therefore we made an instrument that was halfe round, at
the one end<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10546src" href="#xd33e10546" title="Go to note 462.">462</a> hauing 90 degrees marked thereon, whereon we hung a third<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10551src" href="#xd33e10551" title="Go to note 463.">463</a> with a plumet of lead, as the water compasses<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10554src" href="#xd33e10554" title="Go to note 464.">464</a> haue, and therewith we tooke the hight of the sunne when it was at the highest and
found that it was three degrees eleuated aboue the horizon, his declination eleuenth
degrees and sixteene minutes, which beeing added to the height aforesaid made 14 degrees
and 16 minutes, which substracted from 90 degrees, there rested 75 degrees and 44
minutes for the higth of the Pole; but the aforesaid three degrees of higth being
taken at the lowest side of the sunne, the 16 minutes might well be added to the higth
of the Pole, and so it was just 76 degrees, as we had measured it before.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10559src" href="#xd33e10559" title="Go to note 465.">465</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 20 of February it was foule weather with great store of snow, the wind south-west;
whereby we were shut vp againe in the house, as we had been often times before.
</p>
<p>The 21 of February it was still foule weather, the wind north-west and great store
of snow, which made vs greiue more then it did before, for we had no more wood, and
so were forced to breake of<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10695src" href="#xd33e10695" title="Go to note 466.">466</a> some peeces of wood in the house, and to gather vp some that lay troden vnder feet,
which had not bin cast out of the way, whereby for that day and the next night we
holp<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10698src" href="#xd33e10698" title="Go to note 467.">467</a> our selues indifferent well.
</p>
<p>The 22 of February it was clere faire weather with a <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>south-west wind. Then we made ready a slead to fetch more wood, for need compelled
vs thereunto; for, as they say, hunger driueth the wolfe out of his den.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10705src" href="#xd33e10705" title="Go to note 468.">468</a> And eleuen of vs went together, all well appointed with our armes; but coming to
the place where wee should haue the wood, we could not come by it by reason it laie
so deepe vnder the snow, whereby of necessitie we were compelled to goe further, where
with great labour and trouble we got some; but as we returned backe againe therewith,
it was so sore labour vnto vs that we were almost out of comfort, for that by reason
of the long cold<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10714src" href="#xd33e10714" title="Go to note 469.">469</a> and trouble that we had indured, we were become so weake and feeble that we had little
strength, and we began to be in doubt that we should not recover our strengths againe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10718src" href="#xd33e10718" title="Go to note 470.">470</a> and should not be able to fetch any more wood, and so we should haue died with cold;
but the present necessitie and the hope we had of better weather increased our forces,
and made vs doe more then our strengthes afforded. And when we came neere to our house,
we saw much open water in the sea, which in long time we had not seene, which also
put vs in good comfort that things would be better.
</p>
<p>The 23 of February it was calme and faire weather, with a good aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10727src" href="#xd33e10727" title="Go to note 471.">471</a> the wind south-west, and then we tooke two foxes, that were as good to vs as venison.
</p>
<p>The 24<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10734src" href="#xd33e10734" title="Go to note 472.">472</a> of February it was still weather, and a close aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10738src" href="#xd33e10738" title="Go to note 473.">473</a> the wind south-west. Then we drest our springes [and traps] in good sort for the
foxes, but tooke none.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 25 of February it was foule weather againe and much snow, with a north wind, whereby
we were closed vp with snow againe, and could not get out of our house.
</p>
<p>The 26 of February it was darke weather, with a south-west wind, but very calme: and
then we opened our dore againe and exercised our selues with going and running and
to make our ioints supple, which were almost clinged together.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10747src" href="#xd33e10747" title="Go to note 474.">474</a>
</p>
<p>The 27 of February it was calme weather, with a south wind, but very cold. Then our
wood began to lessen, which put vs in no small discomfort to remember what trouble
we had to drawe the last slead-full home, and we must doe the like againe if we would
not die with cold.
</p>
<p>The 28 of February it was still weather with a south-west wind. Then ten of vs went
and fetcht an other slead-full of wood, with no lesse paine and labor then we did
before; for one of our companions could not helpe vs, because that the first ioint
of one of his great toes was frozen of, and so he could doe nothing.
</p>
<p>The first of March it was faire still weather, the wind west but very cold, and we
were forced to spare our wood, because it was so great labor for vs to fetch it; so
that when it was day we exercised our selues as much as we might, with running, going
and leaping; and to them that laie in their cabins<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10757src" href="#xd33e10757" title="Go to note 475.">475</a> we gaue hote<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10762src" href="#xd33e10762" title="Go to note 476.">476</a> stones to warme them, and towards night we made a good fire, which we were forced
to indure.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10765src" href="#xd33e10765" title="Go to note 477.">477</a>
</p>
<p>The 2 of Marche it was cold cleere weather, with a west wind. The same day we tooke
the higth of the sunne, and found that it was eleuated aboue the horizon sixe degrees
and 48 minutes, and his declination was 7 degrees and 12 <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>minutes, which<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10774src" href="#xd33e10774" title="Go to note 478.">478</a> substracted from 90 degrees, resteth 76 degrees for the higth of the Pole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10777src" href="#xd33e10777" title="Go to note 479.">479</a>
</p>
<p>The 3 of March it was faire weather [and calm], with a [south-] west wind; at which
time our sickemen were somewhat better and sat vpright in their cabins to doe some
thing to passe the time awaie, but after they found<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10794src" href="#xd33e10794" title="Go to note 480.">480</a> that they were too ready to stirre before their times.
</p>
<p>The 4 of March it was faire weather with a west wind. The same day there came a beare
to our house, whom we watcht with our peeces as we did before, and shot at her and
hit her, but she run away. At that time fiue of us went to our ship, where we found
that the beares had made worke, and had opened our cookes cubberd,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10801src" href="#xd33e10801" title="Go to note 481.">481</a> that was couered ouer with snow, thinking to find some thing in it, and had drawne
it [a good way] out of the ship, where we found it.
</p>
<p>The 5 of March it was foule weather againe, with a south-west wind: and as in the
euening we had digd open our dore and went out, when the weather began to break vp,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10808src" href="#xd33e10808" title="Go to note 482.">482</a> we saw much open water in the sea, more then before which put vs in good comfort
that in the end we should get away from thence.
</p>
<p>The 6 of March it was foule weather, with a great storme out of the south-west and
much snow. The same day some of vs climbed out of the chimney, and perceaued that
in the sea and about the land there was much open water, but the ship lay fast still.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 7 of March it was still foule weather and as great a wind, so that we were shut
vp in our house, and they that would goe out must clime vp through the chimney, which
was a common thing with vs, and still we sawe more open water in the sea and about
the land, whereby we were in doubt<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10818src" href="#xd33e10818" title="Go to note 483.">483</a> that the ship, in that foule weather and driuing of the ice, would be loose<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10823src" href="#xd33e10823" title="Go to note 484.">484</a> while we were shut vp in our house, and we should haue no meanes to helpe it.
</p>
<p>The 8 of Marche it was still foule weather, with a south-west storme and great store
of snow, whereby we could see no ice north-east nor round about in the sea, whereby
we were of opinion that north-east from vs there was a great sea.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10828src" href="#xd33e10828" title="Go to note 485.">485</a>
</p>
<p>The 9 of March it was foule weather, but not so foule as the [two] day[s] before,
and lesse snow; and then we could see further from vs and perceiue that the water
was open in the north-east, but not from vs towards Tartaria, for there we could still
see ice in the Tartarian Sea, otherwise called the Ice Sea, so that we were of opinion
that there it was not very wide; for, when it was cleere weather, we thought many
times that we saw the land, and showed it vnto our companions, south and [south] south-east
from our house, like a hilly land, as land commonly showeth it selfe when we see it
[from afar off].<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10837src" href="#xd33e10837" title="Go to note 486.">486</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 10 of March it was cleere weather, the wind north. Then we made our house cleane,
and digd our selues out and came forth; at which time we saw [quite] an open sea,
whereupon we said vnto each other that if the ship were loose we might venture to
saile awaie, for we were not of opinion to doe it with our scutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10845src" href="#xd33e10845" title="Go to note 487.">487</a> considering the great cold that we found there. Towards euening, nine of vs went
to the ship with a slead to fetch wood, when al our wood was burnt; and found the
ship in the same order that it laie, and fast in the ice.
</p>
<p>The 11 of March it was cold, but faire sunne-shine weather, the wind north-east; then
we tooke the higth of the sunne with our astrolabium, and found it to be eleuated
aboue the horizon ten degrees and 19 minutes, his declination was three degrees 41
minutes, which being added to the higth aforesaid, made 14 degrees, which substracted
from 90 degrees, there resteth 76 degrees for the higth of the Pole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10851src" href="#xd33e10851" title="Go to note 488.">488</a> Then twelue of vs went to the place where we vsed to goe, to fetch a slead of wood,
but still we had more paine and labour therewith, because we were weaker; and when
we came home with it and were very weary, we praid the master<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10866src" href="#xd33e10866" title="Go to note 489.">489</a> to giue either of vs a draught of wine, which he did, wherewith we were somewhat
releeued and comforted, and after that were the willinger<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10869src" href="#xd33e10869" title="Go to note 490.">490</a> to labour, which was vnsupportable for vs if mere extremitie had not compelled vs
thereunto, saying often times one vnto the other, that if the wood were to be bought
for mony, we would giue all our earnings or wages for it.
</p>
<p>The 12 of March it was foule weather, y<sup>e</sup> wind north-east; then the ice came mightily driuing in, which [by] the south-west
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>winde had bin driuen out, and it was then as could<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10879src" href="#xd33e10879" title="Go to note 491.">491</a> as it had bin before in the coldest time of winter.
</p>
<p>The 13 of March it was still foule weather, with a storme out of the north-east and
great store of snow, and the ice mightely driuing in with a great noyse, the flakes
rustling against each other fearfull to heare.
</p>
<p>The 14 of March it was still foule weather with a great east north-east wind, whereby
the sea was [again] as close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10885src" href="#xd33e10885" title="Go to note 492.">492</a> as it had bin before, and it was extreame cold, whereby our sicke men were very ill,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10888src" href="#xd33e10888" title="Go to note 493.">493</a> who when it was faire weather were stirring too soone.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10893src" href="#xd33e10893" title="Go to note 494.">494</a>
</p>
<p>The 15 of March it was faire weather, the wind north. That day we opened our dore
to goe out, but the cold rather increased then diminished, and was bitterer then before
it had bin.
</p>
<p>The 16 of March it was faire cleare weather, but extreame cold with a north wind,
which put vs to great extremity, for that we had almost taken our leaues of the cold,
and then it began to come againe.
</p>
<p>The 17 of March it was faire cleare weather, with a north-wind, but stil very cold,
wherby wee were wholy out of comfort to see and feele so great cold, and knew not
what to thinke, for it was extreame cold.
</p>
<p>The 18 of March it was foule cold weather with good store of snow, the wind north-east,
which shut vs vp in our house so that we could not get out.

<p>The 19 of March it was still foule and bitter cold weather, the wind north-east, the
ice in the sea cleauing<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10902src" href="#xd33e10902" title="Go to note 495.">495</a> faster and thicker together, with great cracking and a hugh<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10907src" href="#xd33e10907" title="Go to note 496.">496</a> noyse, which we might easily heare in our house, but we delighted not much in hearing
thereof.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 20 of March it was foule weather, bitter cold, and a north-east wind, then our
wood began [by degrees] to consume,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10913src" href="#xd33e10913" title="Go to note 497.">497</a> so that we were forced to take counsell together;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10918src" href="#xd33e10918" title="Go to note 498.">498</a> for without wood we could not liue, and yet we began to be so weake that we could
hardly endure the labour to fetch it.
</p>
<p>The 21 of March it was faire weather, but still very cold, the wind north. The same
day the sunne entred into Aries in the equinoxciall lyne, and at noone we tooke the
hight of the sunne and found it to be eleuated 14 degrees aboue the horizon, but for
that the sun was in the middle lyne and of the like distance from both the tropiks,
there was no declination, neither on the south nor north side; and so the 14 degrees
aforesaid being substracted from ninty degrees, there rested 76 degrees for the hight
of the Pole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e10925src" href="#xd33e10925" title="Go to note 499.">499</a> The same<span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>
day we made shooes of felt or rudg,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11135src" href="#xd33e11135" title="Go to note 500.">500</a> which we drew vpon our feet,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11140src" href="#xd33e11140" title="Go to note 501.">501</a> for we could not goe in our shooes by reason of the great cold, for the shooes on
our feet were as hard as hornes; and then we fetcht a slead-ful of wood home to our
house, with sore and extreame labour and with great extremity of cold, which we endured
as if March<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11145src" href="#xd33e11145" title="Go to note 502.">502</a> went to bid vs fare-well. But<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11153src" href="#xd33e11153" title="Go to note 503.">503</a> our hope and comfort was that the cold could not still continue in that force,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11157src" href="#xd33e11157" title="Go to note 504.">504</a> but that at length the strength thereof<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11162src" href="#xd33e11162" title="Go to note 505.">505</a> would be broken.
</p>
<p>The 22 of March it was cleere still weather, the wind north-east, but very cold; whereupon
some of vs were of advice, seeing that the fetching of wood was so toylesome vnto
vs, that euery day once we should make a fire of coales.
</p>
<p>The 23 of March it was very foule weather, with infernall bitter cold,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11173src" href="#xd33e11173" title="Go to note 506.">506</a> the wind north-east, so that we were forced to make more fire as we had bin at other
times, for then it was as cold as ever it had bin, and it froze very hard in the flore
and vpon the wales of our house.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11180src" href="#xd33e11180" title="Go to note 507.">507</a>
</p>
<p>The 24 of March it was a like cold, with great store of snow and a north wind, whereby
we were once againe shut vp into the house, and then the coales serued vs well, which
before by reason of our bad vsing of them we disliked of.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 25 of March it was still foule weather, the wind west, the cold still holding
as strong as it was, which put vs in much discomfort.
</p>
<p>The 26 of March it was faire cleere weather [with a west wind], and very calme; then
we digd our selues out of the house againe and went out, and then we fetcht an other
slead of wood, for the great cold had made vs burne vp all that we had.
</p>
<p>The 27 of March it was faire weather, the wind west and very calme; then the ice began
to driue away againe, but the ship lay fast and stird not.
</p>
<p>The 28<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11193src" href="#xd33e11193" title="Go to note 508.">508</a> of March it was faire weather, the wind south-west, whereby the ice draue away very
fast [and we had much open water]. The same day sixe of vs went abord the ship to
see how it lay, and found it still in one sort; but we perceiued that the beares had
kept an euil fauoured house therein.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11197src" href="#xd33e11197" title="Go to note 509.">509</a>
</p>
<p>The 29 of March it was faire cleere weather, with a north-east wind; then the ice
came driuing in againe. The same day we fetcht another slead of wood, which we were
euery day worse alike to doe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11204src" href="#xd33e11204" title="Go to note 510.">510</a> by reason of our weaknesse.
</p>
<p>The 30 of March it was faire cleere weather, with an east wind, wherewith the ice
came driving in againe. After noone there came two beares by our house, but they went
along to the ship and let vs alone.
</p>
<p>The 31 of March it was still faire weather, the wind north-east, wherewith the ice
came still more and more driuing in, and made high<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11212src" href="#xd33e11212" title="Go to note 511.">511</a> hilles by sliding one vpon the other.
</p>
<p>The 1 of Aprill it blew stil<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11219src" href="#xd33e11219" title="Go to note 512.">512</a> out of the east, with faire weather, but very cold; and then we burnt some of our
<span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>coales, for that our wood was too troublesome for vs to fetch.
</p>
<p>The 2 of Aprill it was faire weather, the wind north-east and very calme. Then we
tooke the higth of the sunne, and found it to eleuated aboue the horizon 18 degrees
and 40 minutes, his declination being foure degrees and 40 minutes, which being substracted
from the higth aforesaid, there rested 14 degrees, which taken from 90 degrees, the
higth of the Pole was 76 degrees.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11229src" href="#xd33e11229" title="Go to note 513.">513</a>
</p>
<p>The 3 of Aprill it was faire cleere weather, with a north-east wind and very calme;
then we made a staffe to plaie at colfe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11258src" href="#xd33e11258" title="Go to note 514.">514</a> thereby to stretch our jointes, which we sought by all the meanes we could to doe.
</p>
<p>The 4 of Aprill it was faire weather, the wind variable. That daie we went all to
the ship, and put out [through the hawse] the cable that was made fast to the [bower]
anchor, to the end that if the ship chanced to be loose [or to drift] it might hold
fast thereby.
</p>
<p>The 5 of Aprill it was foule weather with a hard north-east wind, wherewith the ice
came mightily in againe and slid in great peeces one vpon the other; and then the
ship laie faster then it did before.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 6 of Aprill it was still foule weather, with a stiffe north-west wind. That night
there came a beare to our house, and we did the best we could to shoot at her, but
because it was moist weather and the cocke foistie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11291src" href="#xd33e11291" title="Go to note 515.">515</a> our peece would not giue fire, wherewith the beare came bouldly toward the house,
and came downe the staires<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11298src" href="#xd33e11298" title="Go to note 516.">516</a> close to the dore,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11303src" href="#xd33e11303" title="Go to note 517.">517</a> seeking to breake into the house; but our master held the dore fast to, and being
in great haste and feare, could not barre it with the peece of wood that we vsed thereunto;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11310src" href="#xd33e11310" title="Go to note 518.">518</a> but the beare seeing that the dore was shut, she went backe againe, and within two
houres after she came againe, and went round about and vpon the top of the house,
and made such a roaring that it was fearefull to heare, and at last got to the chimney,
and made such worke there that we thought she would haue broken it downe, and tore
the saile<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11315src" href="#xd33e11315" title="Go to note 519.">519</a> that was made fast about it in many peeces with a great and fearefull noise; but
for that it was night we made no resistance against her, because we could not see
her. At last she went awaie and left vs.
</p>
<p>The 7 of Aprill it was foule weather, the wind south-west. Then we made our muskets
ready, thinking the beare would haue come againe, but she came not. Then we went up
vpon the house, where we saw what force the beare had vsed to teare away the saile,
which was made so fast vnto the chimney.
</p>
<p>The 8 of Aprill it was still foule weather, the wind south-west, whereby the ice draue
away againe and the sea was open, which put vs in some comfort that we should once
get away out of that fearefull place.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 9 of Aprill it was faire cleere weather, but towards euening it was foule weather,
the wind south-west, so that stil y<sup>e</sup> water became opener, whereat we much reioysed, and gaue God thanks that he had saued
vs from the aforesaid<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11327src" href="#xd33e11327" title="Go to note 520.">520</a> cold, troublesome, hard, bitter, and vnsupportable winter, hoping that time would
giue vs a happy issue.
</p>
<p>The 10 of Aprill it was foule weather, with a storme out of the north-east, with great
store of snowe; at which time the ice that draue away came in againe and couered all
the sea ouer.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11334src" href="#xd33e11334" title="Go to note 521.">521</a>
</p>
<p>The 11 of Aprill it was faire weather, with a great north-east wind, wherewith the
ice still draue one peece vpon another and lay in high hilles.
</p>
<p>The 12<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11342src" href="#xd33e11342" title="Go to note 522.">522</a> of Aprill it was faire cleere weather, but still it blew hard north-east as it had
done two dayes before, so that the ice lay like hilles one upon the other, and then
was higher and harder then it had bin before.
</p>
<p>The 13 of Aprill it was faire cleere weather with a north wind. The same day we fetcht
a slead with wood, and euery man put on his shooes that he had made of felt or rudg,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11349src" href="#xd33e11349" title="Go to note 523.">523</a> which did vs great pleasure.
</p>
<p>The 14 of Aprill it was faire cleare weather with a west wind; then we saw greater
hilles of ice round about the ship then euer we had seene before, which was a fearefull
thing to behold, and much to be wondred at that the ship was not smitten in pieces.
</p>
<p>The 15 of Aprill it was faire calme weather with a north wind; then seauen of vs went
aboard the ship, to see in what case it was, and found it to be all in one sort; and
as we came backe againe there came a great beare towards vs, <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>against whom we began to make defence, but she perceauing that, made away from us,
and we went to the place from whence she came to see her den,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11359src" href="#xd33e11359" title="Go to note 524.">524</a> where we found a great hole made in y<sup>e</sup> ice, about a mans length in depth, the entry thereof being very narrow, and within
wide; there we thrust in our pickes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11367src" href="#xd33e11367" title="Go to note 525.">525</a> to feele if there was any thing within it, but perceauing it was emptie, one of our
men crept into it, but not too farre, for it was fearefull to behold. After that we
went along by the sea side, and there we saw that in the end of March and the beginning
of Aprill the ice was in such wonderfull maner risen and piled vp one vpon the other
that it was wonderfull, in such manner as if there had bin whole townes made of ice,
with towres and bulwarkes round about them.
</p>
<p>The 16 of Aprill it was foule weather, the wind north-west, whereby the ice began
some-what to breake.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11374src" href="#xd33e11374" title="Go to note 526.">526</a>
</p>
<p>The 17 of Aprill it was faire cleere weather with a south-west wind; and then seauen
of vs went to the ship, and there we saw open water in the sea, and then we went ouer
the ice hilles as well as we could to the water, for in six or seauen monthes we had
not gone so neare vnto it; and when we got to y<sup>e</sup> water, there we saw a litle bird swiming therein, but as soone as it espied vs it
diued vnder the water, which we tooke for a signe that there was more open water in
the sea then there had beene before, and that the time approached that the water would
[be] open.
</p>
<p>The 18 of Aprill it was faire weather, the wind south-west. Then we tooke the higth
of the sunne, and it was eleuated aboue the horizon 25 degrees and 10 minutes, his
declination 11 degrees and 12 minutes, which being taken from the higth aforesaid,
there rested 13 degrees and 68 minutes, which substracted from 90 degrees, the higth
of the Pole <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>was found to be 75 degrees, 58 minutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11388src" href="#xd33e11388" title="Go to note 527.">527</a> Then eleuen of vs went with a slead to fetch more wood, and brought it to the house.
In the night there came an other beare vpon our house, which we hearing, went all
out with our armes, but [through the noise we made] the beare ranne away.
</p>
<p>The 19 of Aprill it was faire weather with a north wind. That day fiue of vs went
into the bath to bathe our selues,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11420src" href="#xd33e11420" title="Go to note 528.">528</a> which did vs much good and was a great refreshing vnto vs.
</p>
<p>The 20 of Aprill it was faire weather with a west wind. The same day five of vs went
to the place where we fetcht wood, with a kettle and other furniture<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11427src" href="#xd33e11427" title="Go to note 529.">529</a> vpon a slead, to wash our shirts in that place, because the wood lay ready there,
and for that we were to vse much wood to melt the ice, to heate our water and to drie
our shirtes, esteming it a lesse labour then to bring the wood home to the house,
which was great trouble vnto vs.
</p>
<p>The 21 of Aprill it [still] was faire weather with an east wind; and the next day
the like weather, but in the euening the wind blewe northerly.
</p>
<p>The 23 of Aprill it was faire [clear] weather [with a bright sky] and a [strong] north-east
wind; and the next day the like, with an east wind.
</p>
<p>The 25 of Aprill it was faire [clear] weather, the wind easterly. The same day there
came a beare to our house, and we shoot her into the skin,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11436src" href="#xd33e11436" title="Go to note 530.">530</a> but she runne awaie, which another beare that was not farre from vs perceauing [she
came not nearer to us but] runne away also.
</p>
<p>The 26 and 27 of Aprill it was faire weather, but an extreeme great north-east wind.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 28 of Aprill it was faire weather with a north wind. Then we tooke the higth of
the sunne againe, and found it to be eleuated 28 degrees and 8 minutes, his declination
14 degrees <span class="corr" id="xd33e11447" title="Source: aud">and</span> 8 minutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11450src" href="#xd33e11450" title="Go to note 531.">531</a> which substracted from 90 degrees, there rested 76 degrees for the highth of the
Pole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11453src" href="#xd33e11453" title="Go to note 532.">532</a>
</p>
<p>The 29 of Aprill it was faire weather with a south-west wind. Then we plaid at colfe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11473src" href="#xd33e11473" title="Go to note 533.">533</a> [and at ball], both to the ship and from thence againe homeward, to exercise our
selues.
</p>
<p>The 30 of Aprill it was faire weather [with a bright sky], the wind south-west; then
in the night wee could see the sunne in the north, when it was in the highest,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11478src" href="#xd33e11478" title="Go to note 534.">534</a> iust aboue the horizon, so that from that time we saw the sunne both night and day.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11487src" href="#xd33e11487" title="Go to note 535.">535</a>
</p>
<p>The 1 of May it was faire weather with a west wind; then we sod our last flesh,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11494src" href="#xd33e11494" title="Go to note 536.">536</a> which for a long time we had spared, and it was still very good, and the last morsell
tasted as well <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>as the first, and we found no fault therein but onely that it would last no longer.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11501src" href="#xd33e11501" title="Go to note 537.">537</a>
</p>
<p>The 2 of May it was foule weather with a [seuere] storme out of the south-west, whereby
the sea was almost cleere of ice, and then we began to speake about<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11508src" href="#xd33e11508" title="Go to note 538.">538</a> getting from thence, for we had kept house long enough there.
</p>
<p>The 3 of May it was still foule weather with a south-west wind, whereby the ice began
wholy to driue away, but it lay fast about the ship. And when our best meate, as flesh
and other things, began to faile vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11515src" href="#xd33e11515" title="Go to note 539.">539</a> which was our greatest sustenance, and that it behooued vs to be somewhat strong,
to sustaine the labour that we were to vndergoe when we went from thence, the master
shared the rest of the bacon<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11528src" href="#xd33e11528" title="Go to note 540.">540</a> amongst vs, which was a small barrell with salt bacon in pickle,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11533src" href="#xd33e11533" title="Go to note 541.">541</a> whereof euery one of vs had two ounces a day, which continued for the space of three
weekes, and then it was eaten up.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11538src" href="#xd33e11538" title="Go to note 542.">542</a>
</p>
<p>The 4 of May it was indifferent faire weather, y<sup>e</sup> wind south-west. That day fiue of vs went to the ship, and found <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>it lying still as fast in the ice as it did before;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11550src" href="#xd33e11550" title="Go to note 543.">543</a> for about the midle of March it was but 75 paces from the open water, and then<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11555src" href="#xd33e11555" title="Go to note 544.">544</a> it was 500 paces from the water and inclosed round about with high hilles of ice,
which put vs in no small feare how we should bring our scute and our boate through
or ouer that way into the water when we went to leaue that place. That night there
came [again] a beare to our house, but as soone as she heard vs make a noise she ranne
away againe; one of our men that climbed vp in the chimney saw when she ranne away,
so that it seemed that as then they were afraid of vs, and durst not be so bold to
set vpon vs as they were at the first.
</p>
<p>The 5 of May it was faire weather with some snow, the wind east. That euening and
at night we saw the sunne, when it was at the lowest, a good way aboue the earth.
</p>
<p>The 6 of May it was faire cleere weather with a great south-west wind, whereby we
saw the sea open both in the east and in the west, which made our men exceeding glad,
longing sore to be gone from thence.
</p>
<p>The 7 of May it was foule weather and snew hard, with a north wind, whereby we were
closed vp againe in our house, whereupon our men were somewhat disquieted, saying
that they thought they should neuer goe from thence,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11564src" href="#xd33e11564" title="Go to note 545.">545</a> and therefore, said they, it is best for vs as soone as it is open water to be gone
from hence.
</p>
<p>The 8 of May it was foule weather with great store of snow, the wind west; then some
of our men agreed amongst themselues to speake vnto the master,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11572src" href="#xd33e11572" title="Go to note 546.">546</a> and to tell him that it was more then time for vs to be gone from thence;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11575src" href="#xd33e11575" title="Go to note 547.">547</a> but they could not agree vpon it who should moue the same vnto <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>him,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11584src" href="#xd33e11584" title="Go to note 548.">548</a> because he had said that he would staie<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11589src" href="#xd33e11589" title="Go to note 549.">549</a> vntill the end of June, which was the best of the sommer, to see if the ship would
then be loose.
</p>
<p>The 9 of May it was faire cleere weather with an indifferent wind out of the north-east;
at which time the desire that our men had to be gone from thence still more and more
encreased, and then they agreed to speake to William Barents to moue the master to
goe from thence, but he held them of with faire words [and quieted them]; and yet
it was not done to delay them,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11596src" href="#xd33e11596" title="Go to note 550.">550</a> but to take the best counsell with reason and good aduise, for he heard all what
they could saie.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11601src" href="#xd33e11601" title="Go to note 551.">551</a>
</p>
<p>The 10 of May it was faire weather with a north-west wind; y<sup>t</sup> night, the sun by our common compas being north north-east and at the lowest, we
tooke the higth thereof, and it was eleuated 3 degrees and 45 minutes, his declination
was 17 degrees and 45 minuts, from whence taking the higth aforesaid, there rested
14 degrees, which substracted from 90 degrees, there rested 76 degrees for the higth

<p>The 11 of May it was faire weather, the wind south-west, and then<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11630src" href="#xd33e11630" title="Go to note 553.">553</a> it was [quite] open water in the sea, when our men prayed William Barents once againe
to moue the maister to make preparation to goe from thence, which he promised to do
as soone as conuenient time serued him.
</p>
<p>The 12 of May it was foule weather, the wind north-west; <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>and then the water became still opener then it was, which put vs in good comfort.
</p>
<p>The 13 of May it was still weather, but it snowed hard with a north[-west] wind.
</p>
<p>The 14 of May [it was fine clear weather with a north wind. Then] we fetcht our last
slead with fire wood, and stil ware<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11642src" href="#xd33e11642" title="Go to note 554.">554</a> our shooes made of rugde<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11645src" href="#xd33e11645" title="Go to note 555.">555</a> on our feete, wherewith we did our selues much pleasure, and they furthered vs much.
At the same time we spake to William Barents againe to mooue the maister about going
from thence, which he promised he would doe [on the following day].
</p>
<p>The 15 of May it was faire weather with a west wind, and it was agreed that all our
men should go out to exercise their bodies with running, goeing,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11652src" href="#xd33e11652" title="Go to note 556.">556</a> playing at colfe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11656src" href="#xd33e11656" title="Go to note 557.">557</a> and other exercises, thereby to stirre their ioynts and make them nymble. Meane time
[William] Barents spake vnto the maister and showed him what the company had said,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11661src" href="#xd33e11661" title="Go to note 558.">558</a> who made him answeare that they should stay no longer than to the end of that mounth,
and that if then the ship could not be loosed, that preparation should be made to
goe away with the scute and the boate.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11666src" href="#xd33e11666" title="Go to note 559.">559</a>
</p>
<p>The 16 of May it was faire weather with a west-wind; at which time the company were
glad of the answere that the maister had giuen, but they thought the time too long,
because they were to haue much time<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11673src" href="#xd33e11673" title="Go to note 560.">560</a> to make the boate and <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>the scute ready to put to sea with them, and therefore some of them were of opinion
that it would be best for them to sawe the boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11680src" href="#xd33e11680" title="Go to note 561.">561</a> in the middle and to make it longer; which opinion, though<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11685src" href="#xd33e11685" title="Go to note 562.">562</a> it was not amisse, neuerthelesse it would be y<sup>e</sup> worse for vs, for that although it should be so much the better for the sailing,
it would be so much the vnfitter to be drawne ouer the ice, which we were forced [afterwards]
to doe.
</p>
<p>The 17 and 18 of May it was faire cleere weather with a west wind, and then we [almost]
began to reconne<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11694src" href="#xd33e11694" title="Go to note 563.">563</a> the daies that were set downe and appointed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11697src" href="#xd33e11697" title="Go to note 564.">564</a> for vs to make preparation to be gone.
</p>
<p>The 19 of May it was faire weather with an east wind; then foure of our men went to
the ship or to the sea side, to see what way we should draue the scute into the water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11704src" href="#xd33e11704" title="Go to note 565.">565</a>
</p>
<p>The 20 of May it was foule weather with a north-east wind, whereby the ice began to
come in [strongly] againe; and at noone we spake vnto the maister, and told him that
it was time to make preparation to be gon, if he would euer get away from thence;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11712src" href="#xd33e11712" title="Go to note 566.">566</a> whereunto he made answeare that his owne life was as deere vnto him as any of ours
vnto vs, neuerthelesse he willed vs to make haste to prepare our clothes and other
things ready and fit for our voiage, and that in the meane time we should patch and
amend them, that after it might be no hinderance vnto vs, and that we should stay
till the mounth of May was past, and then make ready the scute and the boate and al
other things fit and conuenient for our iourney.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 21 of May it was faire weather with a north-east wind, so that the ice came driuing
in againe, yet we made preparation touching our things that we should weare, that
we might not be hindred thereby.
</p>
<p>The 22 of May it was faire weather with a north-west wind; and for that we had almost
spent all our wood, we brake the portall of our dore<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11721src" href="#xd33e11721" title="Go to note 567.">567</a> downe and burnt it.
</p>
<p>The 23 of May it was faire weather with an east wind; then some of [us] went againe
to the place where the wood lay, to wash our sheets.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11728src" href="#xd33e11728" title="Go to note 568.">568</a>
</p>
<p>The 24 of May it was faire weather with a south-east wind, whereby there was but little
open water.
</p>
<p>The 25 of May it was faire weather with an east wind. Then at noone time we tooke
the higth of the sunne, that was eleuated aboue the horizon 34 degrees and 46 minutes,
his declination 20 degrees and 46 minutes, which taken from the higth aforesaid, there
rested 14 degrees, which taken from 90 degrees<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11736src" href="#xd33e11736" title="Go to note 569.">569</a> resteth 76 degrees for the higth of the Pole.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e11741src" href="#xd33e11741" title="Go to note 570.">570</a>

<p>The 26 of May it was faire weather with a great north-east wind, whereby the ice came
[drifting] in againe [with great force].
</p>
<p>The 27 of May it was foule weather with a great north-east wind, which draue the ice
mightely in againe, whereupon the maister, at the motion<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12053src" href="#xd33e12053" title="Go to note 571.">571</a> of the company, willed vs [immediately to begin] to make preparation to be gon.
</p>
<p>The 28 of May it was foule weather with a north-west wind; after noone it began to
be somewhat better. Then seuen of vs went vnto the ship, and fetcht such things from
thence as should serue vs for the furnishing of our scute and our boate, as the old
fock sayle<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12060src" href="#xd33e12060" title="Go to note 572.">572</a> to make a sayle<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12065src" href="#xd33e12065" title="Go to note 573.">573</a> for our boate and our scute, and some tackles and other things necessarie for vs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12070src" href="#xd33e12070" title="Go to note 574.">574</a>
</p>
<p>The 29 of May in the morning it was reasonable fair <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>weather with a west wind; then ten of vs went vnto the scute to bring it to the house
to dresse it and make it ready to sayle,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12079src" href="#xd33e12079" title="Go to note 575.">575</a> but [on coming to it] we found it deepe hidden vnder y<sup>e</sup> snow, and were faine with great paine and labour to dig it out, but when we had gotten
it out of the snow, and thought to draw it to the house, we could not doe it, because
we were too weake, wherewith we became wholely out of heart, doubting that we should
not be able to goe forwarde with our labour; but the maister encouraging vs bad vs
striue to do more then we were able, saying that both our liues and our wellfare consisted
therein, and that if we could not get the scute from thence and make it ready, then
he said we must dwell there as burgers<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12087src" href="#xd33e12087" title="Go to note 576.">576</a> of Noua Zembla, and make our graues in that place. But there wanted no good will
in vs, but onely strength, which made vs for that time to leaue of worke and let the
scute lye stil, which was no small greefe unto vs and trouble to thinke what were
best for vs to doe. But after noone, being thus comfortlesse come home, wee tooke
hearts againe, and determined to tourne the boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12092src" href="#xd33e12092" title="Go to note 577.">577</a> that lay by the house with her keale vpwards, and [we began] to amend it [and to
heighten the gunwales, so] that it might be y<sup>e</sup> fitter to carry vs ouer the sea, for we made full account y<sup>t</sup> we had a long troublesom voiage in hand, wherin we might haue many crosses, and wherin
we should not be sufficiently prouided for all things necessarie, although we tooke
neuer so much care; and while we were busy about our worke, there came a great<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12104src" href="#xd33e12104" title="Go to note 578.">578</a> beare vnto vs, wherewith we went into our house and stood to watch her in our three
dores with harquebushes, and one stood in the chimney with a musket. This beare came
boldlyer<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12109src" href="#xd33e12109" title="Go to note 579.">579</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>vnto vs than euer any had done before, for she came to the neather<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12114src" href="#xd33e12114" title="Go to note 580.">580</a> step y<sup>t</sup> went to one of our doores, and the man that stood in the doore saw her not because
he lookt towards the other doore, but they that stood within saw her and in great
feare called to him, wherewith he turned about, and although he was in a maze he shot
at her, and the bullet past cleane through her body, whereupon she ran away. Yet it
was a fearfull thing to see, for the beare was almost vpon him before he saw her,
so that if the peece had failed to giue fire, (as often times they doe) it had cost
him his life, and it may be y<sup>t</sup> the beare would haue gotten into y<sup>e</sup> house. The beare being gone somewhat from the house, lay downe, wherewith we went
all armed [with guns, muskets, and half-pikes] and killed her outright, and when we
had ript open her belly we found a peece of a bucke therein, with haire, skin and
all,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12127src" href="#xd33e12127" title="Go to note 581.">581</a> which not long before she had towrne<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12134src" href="#xd33e12134" title="Go to note 582.">582</a> and deuoured.
</p>
<p>The 30 of May it was indifferent faire weather, but very cold and close aire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12140src" href="#xd33e12140" title="Go to note 583.">583</a> the wind west; then we began [again with all our men that were fit for it] to set
our selues to worke about the boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12147src" href="#xd33e12147" title="Go to note 584.">584</a> to amend it, the rest staying in the house to make the sailes and all other things
ready that were necessarie for vs. But while we were busie working at our boate, there
came [again] a beare vnto vs, wherewith we were forced to leaue worke, but she was
shot by our men. Then we brake downe the plankes of the rooffe of our house, to amend
our boate withall,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12152src" href="#xd33e12152" title="Go to note 585.">585</a> and so proceeded in our worke as well as we could; for every man was willing to labour,
for we had sore longed for it, and did more then we were able to doe.
</p>
<p>The 31 of May it was faire weather, but somewhat colder <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>then before, the wind being south-west, whereby the ice draue away, and we wrought
hard about our boate; but when [we] were in the chiefest part of worke, there came
an other beare, as if they had smelt that we would be gone, and that therefore they
desired to tast a peece of some of vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12161src" href="#xd33e12161" title="Go to note 586.">586</a> for that was the third day, one after the other, that they set so fiercely vpon vs;
so that we were forced to leaue our worke and goe into the house, and she followed
vs, but we stood with our peeces to watch her, and shot three peeces at her, two from
our dores and one out of the chimney, which all three hit her, whereby she fared as
the dogge did with the pudding;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12166src" href="#xd33e12166" title="Go to note 587.">587</a> but her death did vs more hurt then her life, for after we ript her belly we drest
her liuer and eate it, which in the taste liked vs well, but it made vs all sicke,
specially three that were exceeding sicke, and we verily thought that we should haue
lost them, for all their skins came of from the foote to the head, but yet they recouered
againe, for the which we gave God heartie thankes, for if as then we had lost these
three men, it was a hundred to one<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12171src" href="#xd33e12171" title="Go to note 588.">588</a> that we should neuer haue gotten from thence, because we should haue had too few
men to draw and lift at our neede.
</p>
<p>[June, 1597.]
</p>
<p>The 1 of June it was faire [beautiful] weather, and then our men were for the most
part sicke with eating the liuer of a<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12179src" href="#xd33e12179" title="Go to note 589.">589</a> beare, as it is said before, whereby that day there was nothing done about the boate;
and then there hung a pot still ouer the fire with some of the liuer in it, but the
master tooke it and cast it out of the dore, for we had enough of the sawce thereof.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12184src" href="#xd33e12184" title="Go to note 590.">590</a> That day foure of our men <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>that were the best in health went to the ship, to see if there was any thing in it
that would serue vs in our voiage, and there found a barrell with geep,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12193src" href="#xd33e12193" title="Go to note 591.">591</a> which we shared amongst our men, whereof every one had two, and it did vs great pleasure.
</p>
<p>The 2 of June, in the morning, it was faire weather with a south-west wind; and then
sixe of vs went to see and finde out the best way for vs to bring our boate and our
scute to the water side, for as then the ice laie so high and so thicke one vpon the
other, that it seemed [almost] unpossible to draw or get our boate and the scute ouer
the ice, and the shortest and best way that we could find was straight from the ship
to the water side,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12204src" href="#xd33e12204" title="Go to note 592.">592</a> although it was full of hilles and altogether vneuen and would be great labour and
trouble vnto vs, but because of the shortnesse we esteemed it to be the best way for
vs.
</p>
<p>The 3 of June, in the morning, it was faire cleare [sunny] weather, the wind west;
and then we were [again become] somewhat [stronger and] better [of our sickness],
and tooke great paines with the boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12211src" href="#xd33e12211" title="Go to note 593.">593</a> that at last we got it ready after we had wrought sixe daies vpon it. About euening
it began to blow hard, and therewith the water was very open, which put vs in good
comfort that our deliuerance would soone follow, and that we should once get out of
that desolate and fearefulle place.
</p>
<p>The 4 of June it was faire cleere [sunny] weather and <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>indifferent warme;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12220src" href="#xd33e12220" title="Go to note 594.">594</a> and about y<sup>e</sup> south-east sun [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] eleuen of vs went to our scute [on the beach] where it then lay, and drew it to[wards]
the ship, at which time the labour seemed lighter vnto vs then it did before when
we tooke it in hand and were forced to leaue it off againe. The reason thereof was
the opinion that we had that the snow as then lay harder vpon the ground and so was
become stronger, and it may be that our courages were better to see that the time
gaue vs open water, and that our hope was that we should get from thence; and so three
of our men stayd by the scute to build her to our mindes, and for that it was a herring
scute, which are made narrow behind, therefore they sawed it [a little] of behinde,
and made it a broad stearne and better to broke the seas;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12231src" href="#xd33e12231" title="Go to note 595.">595</a> they built it also somewhat higher, and drest it vp as well they could.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12237src" href="#xd33e12237" title="Go to note 596.">596</a> The rest of our men were busy in the house to make all other things ready for our
voiage, and that day drew two sleads with victuals and other goods [from the house]
vnto the ship, that lay about halfe way betweene the house and the open water, [so]
that after they might haue so much y<sup>e</sup> shorter way to carry the goods vnto y<sup>e</sup> water side, when we should goe away. At which time al the labour and paines that
we tooke seemed light and easie vnto vs, because of the hope that we had to get out
of that wild, desart, irkesome, fearefull, and cold country.
</p>
<p>The 5 of June it was foule [uncomfortable] weather with great store of haile and snow,
the wind west, which made an open water; but as then we could doe nothing without
the house, but within we made all things ready, as sailes, oares, <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>mastes, sprit, rother, swerd,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12252src" href="#xd33e12252" title="Go to note 597.">597</a> and all other necessarie things.
</p>
<p>The 6 of June in the morning it was faire weather, the wind north-east. Then we went
with our carpenters to the ship to build vp our scute, and carried two sleades-full
of goods into the ship, both victualles and marchandise, with other things, which
we ment to take with vs. After that there rose very foul weather in the south-west,
with snow, haile, and [also] raine, which we in long time had not had, whereby the
carpenters were forced to leaue their worke and goe home to the house with vs, where
also we could not be drie, [for] because we had taken of the deales [from the house],
therewith to amend our boate and our scute; there laie but a saile ouer it, which
would not hold out the water, and the way that laie full of snow began to be soft,
so that we left of our shoes made of rugge and felt<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12264src" href="#xd33e12264" title="Go to note 598.">598</a>, and [again] put on our leather shoes.
</p>
<p>The 7 of June there blew a great north-east wind, whereby we saw the ice come driuing
in againe; but the sunne being south-east [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] it was faire weather againe, and then the carpenters went to the scute againe to
make an end of their worke, and we packed the marchants goods that we ment to take
with vs [the best and most valuable goods], and made defences for our selues of the
said packes to saue vs from the sea<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12274src" href="#xd33e12274" title="Go to note 599.">599</a> [as we had to carry them] in the open scute.
</p>
<p>The 8 of June it was faire weather, and we drew the wares to the ship which we had
packed and made ready; and the carpenters <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>made ready the scute, so that the same euening it was almost done. The same day all
our men went to draw our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12283src" href="#xd33e12283" title="Go to note 600.">600</a> to the ship, and made ropes to draw withall, such as we vse to draw with in scutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12288src" href="#xd33e12288" title="Go to note 601.">601</a> which we cast ouer our shoulders and held fast with all our hands,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12293src" href="#xd33e12293" title="Go to note 602.">602</a> and so drew both with our hands and our shoulders, which gaue vs more force, and
specially the desire and great pleasure we tooke to worke at that time made vs stronger,
so that we did more then then at other times we should haue done, for that good will
on the one side and hope on the other side encreased our strenght.
</p>
<p>The 9 of June it was faire weather with variable windes. Then we washt our shirts
and all our linnen against we should be ready to saile away, and the carpenters were
still busie to make an end of the boate and the scute.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12301src" href="#xd33e12301" title="Go to note 603.">603</a>
</p>
<p>The 10 of June we carried foure sleades of goods into the ship, the wind then being
variable; and at euening it was northerly, and we were busie in the house to make
all things ready. The wine that was left we put into litle vessels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12314src" href="#xd33e12314" title="Go to note 604.">604</a> that so we might deuide it into both our vessels,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12319src" href="#xd33e12319" title="Go to note 605.">605</a> and that as we were inclosed by the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12324src" href="#xd33e12324" title="Go to note 606.">606</a> (which we well knew would happen vnto vs) we might the easelier cast the goods vpon
the ice, both out and into the scutes, as time and place serued vs.
</p>
<p>The 11 of June it was foule weather and it blew hard north north-west, so that all
day we could doe nothing, and we were in great feare least the storme would carry
the ice and the ship both away together (which might well haue come to passe); then
we should haue beene in greater miserie <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>than ever we were, for that our goods, both victualles and others, were then all in
the ship; but God prouided so well for vs that it fell not out so unfortunatly.

<p>The 12 of June it was indifferent faire weather; then we went with hatchets, halberds,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12339src" href="#xd33e12339" title="Go to note 607.">607</a> shouels and others instruments, to make the way plaine where we should draw the scute

of ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12344src" href="#xd33e12344" title="Go to note 608.">608</a> where we wrought sore with our hatchets and other instruments.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12349src" href="#xd33e12349" title="Go to note 609.">609</a> And while we were in the chiefest of our worke, there came a great leane beare out
of the sea vpon the ice towards vs, which we iudged to come out of Tartaria, for we
had [before] seene of them twenty or thirty [80 or 120] miles within the sea; and
for that we had no muskets but only one which our surgian<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12354src" href="#xd33e12354" title="Go to note 610.">610</a> carried, I ran in great haste towards the ship to fetch one or two, which the beare
perceiuing ran [quickly and boldly] after me, and was very likely to haue ouer taken
me, but our company seeing that, left their worke and ran [quickly] after her, which
made the beare turn towards them and left me; but when she ran towards them, she was
shot into the body by the surgian, and ran away, but because the ice was so uneuen
and hilly she could not go farre, but being by vs ouer taken we killed her out right,
and smot<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12359src" href="#xd33e12359" title="Go to note 611.">611</a> her teeth out of her head while she was yet liuing.
</p>
<p>The 13 of June it was faire weather; then the maister and the carpenters went to the
ship, and there made the scute and the boate ready, so that there rested nothing as
then but onely to bring it downe to the water side. The maister and those that were
with him, seeing that it was open water and a good west wind, came back to the house
againe, and there <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>he spake vnto William Barents (that had bin long sicke), and shewed him that he thought
it good (seeing it was a fit time) to goe from thence, and so willed the company<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12366src" href="#xd33e12366" title="Go to note 612.">612</a> to driue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12371src" href="#xd33e12371" title="Go to note 613.">613</a> the boate and the scute downe to the water side, and in the name <span class="corr" id="xd33e12376" title="Not in source">of </span>God to begin our voiage to saile from Noua Zembla. Then William Barents wrote a letter,
which he put into a muskets charge<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12378src" href="#xd33e12378" title="Go to note 614.">614</a> and hanged it vp in the chimney, shewing how we<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12386src" href="#xd33e12386" title="Go to note 615.">615</a> came out of Holland to saile to the kingdome of China, and what had happened vnto
vs being there on land, with all our crosses, that if any man chanced to come thither,
they might know what had happened vnto vs [how we had fared], and how we had bin forced
in our extremity to make that house, and had dwelt 10 mounthes therein. And for that
we were [now forced] to put to sea in two small open boates and to vndertake a dangerous
and aduenterous voiage in hand, the maister [also] wrote two letters, which most of
vs subscribed vnto, signifying how we had stayed there vpon the land in great trouble
and miserie, in hope that our ship would be freed from the ice and that we should
saile away with it againe, and how it fell out to the contrary, and that the ship
lay fast in the ice; so that in the end, the time passing away and our victuals beginning
to faile vs, we were forced, for the sauing of our owne liues, to leaue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12390src" href="#xd33e12390" title="Go to note 616.">616</a> the ship and to saile away in our open boates, and so to commit our selues into the
hands of God. Which done, he put into each of our scutes a letter,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12393src" href="#xd33e12393" title="Go to note 617.">617</a> y<sup>t</sup> if we chanced to loose one another or y<sup>t</sup> by stormes or any other misaduenture we <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>hapened to be cast away, that then by the scute that escaped men might know how we
left each other. And so, hauing finished all things as we determined, we drew the
boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12407src" href="#xd33e12407" title="Go to note 618.">618</a> to the water side and left a man in it, and went and fetcht the scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12412src" href="#xd33e12412" title="Go to note 619.">619</a> and after that eleuen sleads with goods, as victuals and some wine that yet remained,
and the marchants goods which we preserued as wel as we could,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12415src" href="#xd33e12415" title="Go to note 620.">620</a> viz., 6 packs with [the] fine[st] wollen cloth, a chest with linnen, two packets
w<sup>t</sup> ueluet, two smal chests with mony, two drifats<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12423src" href="#xd33e12423" title="Go to note 621.">621</a> with the mens clothes [such as shirts], and other things, 13 barrels of bread, a
barrell of cheese,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12428src" href="#xd33e12428" title="Go to note 622.">622</a> a fletch of bacon, two runlets of oyle, 6 small runlets of wine, two runlets of vinegar,
with other packs [and clothes] belonging to y<sup>e</sup> sailers [and many other things]; so that when they lay altogether upon a heape, a
man would haue iudged that they would not haue gone into the scutes. Which being all
put into them, we went to the house, and first drew William Barents vpon a slead to
the place where our scutes lay, and after that we fetcht Claes Adrianson,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12444src" href="#xd33e12444" title="Go to note 623.">623</a> both of them hauing bin long sicke. And so we [being] entred into the scutes and
deuided our selues into each of them alike, and put into either of them a sicke man,
then the maister caused both the scutes to ly close one by the other, and there we
subscribed to the letters which he had written [as is above mentioned], the coppie
whereof hereafter ensueth. And so committing our selues to the will and mercie of
God, with a west north-west wind and an endifferent open water, we set saile and put
to sea.

<p><i>The Coppie of their Letter.</i>
</p>
<p>Hauing till this day stayd for the time and opportunity, in hope to get our ship loose,
and now are cleane out of hope thereof,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12458src" href="#xd33e12458" title="Go to note 624.">624</a> for that it lyeth fast shut vp and inclosed in the ice, and in the last<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12463src" href="#xd33e12463" title="Go to note 625.">625</a> of March and the first<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12466src" href="#xd33e12466" title="Go to note 626.">626</a> of April the ice did so mightily gather together in great hils, that we could not
deuise<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12469src" href="#xd33e12469" title="Go to note 627.">627</a> how to get our scute and boate into the water and<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12474src" href="#xd33e12474" title="Go to note 628.">628</a> where to find a conuenient place for it. And for that it seemed almost impossible
to get the ship out of the ice, therefore I and William Barents our pilot,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12479src" href="#xd33e12479" title="Go to note 629.">629</a> and other the officers and company of sailors thereunto belonging, considering with
our selues which would be the best course for vs to saue our owne liues and some wares
belonging to the marchants, we could find no better meanes then to mend our boate
and scute, and to prouide our selues as well as we could of all things necessarie,
that being ready we might not loose or ouerslip any fit time and opportunity that
God should <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>send vs; for that it stood us vpon<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12486src" href="#xd33e12486" title="Go to note 630.">630</a> to take the fittest time, otherwise we should surely haue perished with hunger and
cold, which as yet is to be feared will goe hard inough with vs, for that there are
three or foure of vs that are not able to stirre to doe any thinge,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12489src" href="#xd33e12489" title="Go to note 631.">631</a> and the best and strongest of us are so weake with the great cold and diseases that
we haue so long time endured, that we haue but halfe a mans strength; and it is to
be feared that it will rather be worse then better, in regard of the long voiage that
we haue in hand, and our bread wil not last vs longer then to the end of the mounth
of August, and it may easily fal out, that the voiage being contrary and crosse vnto
vs, that before that time we shall not be able to get to any land, where we may procure
any victuals or other prouisions for our selues, as we haue hitherto done our best;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12494src" href="#xd33e12494" title="Go to note 632.">632</a> therefore we thought it our best course not to stay any longer here, for by nature
we are bound to seeke our owne good and securities. And so we determined hereupon,
and haue vnder written this present letter with our owne hands,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12499src" href="#xd33e12499" title="Go to note 633.">633</a> vpon the first of June 1597. And while vpon the same day we were ready and had a
west wind [with an easy breeze] and an indifferent open sea, we did in Gods name prepare
our selues and entred into our voiage, the ship lying as fast as euer it did inclosed
in the ice, notwithstanding that while we were making ready to be gon, we had great
wind out of the west, north, and north-west, and yet find no alteration nor bettering
in the weather, and therefore in the last extremity we left it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12505src" href="#xd33e12505" title="Go to note 634.">634</a> [Dated] vpon the 13 of June [and signed by] Jacob Hemskerke, Peter Peterson Vos,

<p>The 14 of June in the morning, the sunne easterly [½ p. 4 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>], we [by God’s mercy] put of from the land of Noua Zembla and the fast ice therevnto
adioyning, with our boate and our scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12557src" href="#xd33e12557" title="Go to note 637.">637</a> hauing a west wind, and sailed east north-east all that day to the Ilands Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12561src" href="#xd33e12561" title="Go to note 638.">638</a> which was fiue [20] miles; but our first beginning was not very good, for we entered
fast into the ice againe, which there laie very hard and fast, which put vs into no
smal feare and trouble; and being there, foure of us went on land, to know the scituation
thereof, and there we tooke many<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12565src" href="#xd33e12565" title="Go to note 639.">639</a> birds, which we kild with stones vpon the cliftes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12576src" href="#xd33e12576" title="Go to note 640.">640</a>
</p>
<p>The 15 of June the ice began to goe away; then we put to saile againe with a south
wind, and past along by the Head Point<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12581src" href="#xd33e12581" title="Go to note 641.">641</a> and the Flushingers Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12585src" href="#xd33e12585" title="Go to note 642.">642</a> streaching most north-east, and after that north, to the Point of Desire,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12590src" href="#xd33e12590" title="Go to note 643.">643</a> which is about 13 [52] miles, and there we laie till the 16 of June.
</p>
<p>The 16 of June we set saile againe, and got to the Island[s] of Orange<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12597src" href="#xd33e12597" title="Go to note 644.">644</a> with a south wind, which is 8 [32] miles distant from the Point of Desire; there
we went one land with two small barrels and a kettle, to melt snow and to put y<sup>e</sup> water into y<sup>e</sup> barrels, as also to seeke for birds and egges to make meate for our sicke men; and
being there we made fire with such wood as wee found there, and melted the snowe,
but found no birds; but three of our men went ouer the ice to the other island, and
got three birds, and as we came backe againe, our maister (which was one of the three)
fell into the ice, where he was in great danger of his life, for in that place there
ran a great streame;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12607src" href="#xd33e12607" title="Go to note 645.">645</a> but by Gods helpe he got out againe and came to vs, and there dryed himselfe by the
fire that we had made, at which fire we drest the <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>birds, and carried them to the scute to our sicke men, and filled our two runlets
with water that held about eight gallons<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12615src" href="#xd33e12615" title="Go to note 646.">646</a> a peece; which done, we put to the sea againe with a south-east wind and drowsie
miseling weather,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12622src" href="#xd33e12622" title="Go to note 647.">647</a> whereby we were al dankish<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12627src" href="#xd33e12627" title="Go to note 648.">648</a> and wet, for we had no shelter in our open scutes, and sailed west and west and by
south to [opposite] the Ice Point.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12632src" href="#xd33e12632" title="Go to note 649.">649</a> And being there, both our scutes lying hard by each other, the maister<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12636src" href="#xd33e12636" title="Go to note 650.">650</a> called to William Barents to know how he did, and William Barents made answeare and
said, Well, God be thanked, and I hope before we get to Warehouse to be able to goe.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12641src" href="#xd33e12641" title="Go to note 651.">651</a> Then he spake to me and said, Gerrit, are we about the Ice Point? If we be, then
I pray you lift me vp, for I must veiw it once againe;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12647src" href="#xd33e12647" title="Go to note 652.">652</a> at which time we had sailed from the Island[s] of Orange to the Ice Points about
fiue [20] miles; and then the wind was<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12654src" href="#xd33e12654" title="Go to note 653.">653</a> westerly, and we made our scuts fast to a great peece of ice<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12659src" href="#xd33e12659" title="Go to note 654.">654</a> and there eate somewhat; but the weather was still fouler and fouler, so that we
were once againe inclosed with ice and forced to stay there.
</p>
<p>The 17 of June in the morning, when we had broken our fastes, the ice came so fast<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12667src" href="#xd33e12667" title="Go to note 655.">655</a> vpon vs that it made our haires stare<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12672src" href="#xd33e12672" title="Go to note 656.">656</a> vpright vpon our heades, it was so fearefull to behold; <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>by which meanes we could not make fast<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12677src" href="#xd33e12677" title="Go to note 657.">657</a> our scutes, so that we thought verily that it was a foreshewing of our last end;
for we draue away so hard with the ice, and were so sore prest between a flake of
ice, that we thought verily the scutes would burst in a hundredth peeces, which made
vs looke pittifully one upon the other, for no counsell nor aduise was to be found,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12682src" href="#xd33e12682" title="Go to note 658.">658</a> but euery minute of an houre<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12688src" href="#xd33e12688" title="Go to note 659.">659</a> we saw death before our eies. At last, being in this discomfort and extreeme necessity,
y<sup>e</sup> master said<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12696src" href="#xd33e12696" title="Go to note 660.">660</a> if we could take hold with a rope vpon the fast ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12701src" href="#xd33e12701" title="Go to note 661.">661</a> we might therewith drawe y<sup>e</sup> scute vp, and so get it out of the great drift of ice. But as this counsell was good,
yet it was so full of daunger, that it was the hazard of his life that should take
vpon him to doe it; and without doing it, was it most certaine y<sup>t</sup> it would cost us all our liues. This counsell (as I said) was good, but no man (like
to the tale of y<sup>e</sup> mise) durst hang the bell about y<sup>e</sup> cats necke, fearing to be drowned; yet necessity required to haue it done, and the
most danger made vs chuse the least. So that being in that perplexity [and as a drowned
calf may safely be risked],<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12719src" href="#xd33e12719" title="Go to note 662.">662</a> I being the lightest of all our company tooke on me to fasten<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12724src" href="#xd33e12724" title="Go to note 663.">663</a> a rope vpon the fast ice; and so creeping from one peece of driuing ice to another,
by Gods help got to the fast ice, where I made a rope fast to a high howell,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12729src" href="#xd33e12729" title="Go to note 664.">664</a> and they that were in the scute drew it thereby vnto <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>the said fast ice, and then one man alone could drawe more than all of them could
have done before. And when we had gotten thither, in all haste we tooke our sicke
men out and layd them vpon the ice, laying clothes and other things vnder them [for
them to rest on], and then tooke all our goods out of the scutes, and so drew them
vpon the ice, whereby for that time we were deliuered from that great danger, making
account that we had escaped out of death’s clawes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12737src" href="#xd33e12737" title="Go to note 665.">665</a> as it was most true.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The 18 of June we repaired and amended our scutes againe, being much bruised and crushed
with the racking of the ice, and were forced to driue all the nailes fast againe,
and to peece many things about them,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12748src" href="#xd33e12748" title="Go to note 666.">666</a> God sending vs wood wherewith we moult our pitch, and did all other things that belonged
thereunto. That done, some of vs went vpon the land<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12753src" href="#xd33e12753" title="Go to note 667.">667</a> to seeke for egges, which the sick men longed for, but we could find none, but we
found foure birds, not without great danger of our liues betweene the ice and the
firme land, wherein we often fell, and were in no small danger.
</p>
<p>The 19 of June it was indifferent weather, the wind north-west, and [during the day
west and] west south-west, but we were still shut vp in the ice and saw no opening,
which made us thinke that there would be our last aboade, and that we should neuer
get from thence; but on the other side we comforted our selves againe, that seeing
God had helped vs oftentimes unexpectedly in many perils, and that his arme as yet
was not shortened, but that he could [still] helpe vs<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12760src" href="#xd33e12760" title="Go to note 668.">668</a> at his good will and pleasure, it made vs somewhat comfortable, and caused vs to
speake cheerfully one unto the other.
</p>
<p>The 20 of June it was indifferent weather, the wind west, <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>and when the sunne was south-east [½ p. 7 <span class="asc">A.M.</span>] Claes Adrianson<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12771src" href="#xd33e12771" title="Go to note 669.">669</a> began to be extreme sicke, whereby we perceiued that he would not liue long, and
the boateson<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12776src" href="#xd33e12776" title="Go to note 670.">670</a> came into our scute<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12781src" href="#xd33e12781" title="Go to note 671.">671</a> and told vs in what case he was, and that he could not long continue aliue; whereupon
William Barents spake and said, I thinke I shal not liue long after him;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12787src" href="#xd33e12787" title="Go to note 672.">672</a> and yet we did not ivdge William Barents to be so sicke, for we sat talking one with
the other, and spake of many things, and William Barents read in my card which I had
made touching our voiage,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12792src" href="#xd33e12792" title="Go to note 673.">673</a> [and we had some discussion about it]; at last he laid away the card and spake vnto
me, saying, Gerrit, give me some drinke;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12797src" href="#xd33e12797" title="Go to note 674.">674</a> and he had no sooner drunke but he was taken with so sodain a qualme, that he turned
his eies in his head and died presently, and we had no time to call the maister out
of the [other] scute to speake vnto him; and so he died before Claes Adrianson [who
died shortly after him]. The death of William Barents put vs in no small discomfort,
as being the chiefe guide and onely pilot on whom we reposed our selues next vnder
God;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12802src" href="#xd33e12802" title="Go to note 675.">675</a> but we could not striue against God, and therefore we must of force be content.
</p>
<p>The 21 of June the ice began to driue away againe, and God made vs some opening with
[a] south south-west wind; and when the sunne was [about] north west the wind began
to blow south-east with a good gale, and we began to make preparations to go from
thence.
</p>
<p>The 22 of June, in the morning, it blew a good gale out of the south-east, and then
the sea was reasonable open, but we <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>were forced to draw our scutes ouer the ice to get vnto it, which was great paine
and labour vnto vs, for first we were forced to draw our scutes ouer a peece of ice
of 50 paces long, and there put them into the water, and then againe to draw them
vp vpon other ice, and after draw them at the least 300<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12810src" href="#xd33e12810" title="Go to note 676.">676</a> paces more ouer the ice, before we could bring them to a good place, where we might
easily get out. And being gotten vnto the open water, we committed our selues to God
and set saile, the sunne being about east-north-east, with an indifferent gale of
wind out of the south and south-south-east, and sailed west and west and by south,
till the sunne was south, and than we were round about enclosed with ice againe, and
could not get out, but were forced to lie still. But not long after the ice opened
againe like to a sluce<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12814src" href="#xd33e12814" title="Go to note 677.">677</a> and we passed through it and set saile againe, and so sailed along by the land, but
were presently enclosed with ice; but, being in hope of opening againe, meane time
we eate somewhat, for the ice went not away as it did before. After that we vsed all
the meanes we could to breake it, but all in vaine; and yet a good while after the
ice opened againe [of itself], and we got out and sailed along by the land, west and
by south, with a south wind.
</p>
<p>The 23 of June we sailed still forward west and by south till the sunne was south-east,
and got to the Trust Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12821src" href="#xd33e12821" title="Go to note 678.">678</a> which is distant from the Ice Point 25 [100] miles, and then could go noe further
because the ice laie so hard and so close together; and yet it was faire weather.
The same day we tooke the hight of the sunne with the <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: astrolabium">astralabium</span> and also with our astronomicall ring, and found his hight to be 37 degrees, and his
declination 23 degrees and 30 minutes, which taken from the hight aforesaid, there
rested 13 degrees and 30 minutes, which substracted out of 90 degrees, the hight of
the Pole was 76 degrees and 30 <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>minutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12831src" href="#xd33e12831" title="Go to note 679.">679</a> And it was faire sunne-shine weather, and yet it was not so strong as to melt the
snow that we might haue water to drink; so that we set all our tin platers and other
things<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e12843src" href="#xd33e12843" title="Go to note 680.">680</a> full of snow [in the sun] to melt, and so molt it [by the reflection of the sun,

<p>The 24 of June, the sunne being easterly, we rowed here and there [round about] in
the ice, to see where <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>we might best goe out, but we saw no opening; but when the sunne was south we got
through into the sea, for the which we thanked God most heartilie that he had sent
vs an vnexpected opening; and then we sailed with an east wind and went lustily forward,
so that we made our account to get aboue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13266src" href="#xd33e13266" title="Go to note 727.">727</a> the Point of Nassawes;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13269src" href="#xd33e13269" title="Go to note 728.">728</a> [but we were again prevented by the ice which beset us, so that we were obliged to
stop on the east side of the Point of Nassau] close by the land, and we could easily
see the Point of Nassawes, and made our account to be about 3 [12] miles from it,
the wind being south and south south-west. Then sixe of our men went on land and there
found some wood, whereof they brought as much as they could into the scutes, but found
neither birds nor egges; with the which wood they sod<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13272src" href="#xd33e13272" title="Go to note 729.">729</a> a pot of water pap (which we called matsammore<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13275src" href="#xd33e13275" title="Go to note 730.">730</a>), that we might eate some warme thing, the wind blowing stil southerly, [and the
longer it blew the stronger it grew.]
</p>
<p>The 25th of June it blew a great south wind, and the ice whereunto we made our selues
fast was not very strong, whereby we were in greate feare that we should breake off
from it and driue into the sea; for [in the evening], when the sun was in the west,
a peece of that ice brake of, whereby we were forced to dislodge and make our selues
fast to another peece of ice.
</p>
<p>The 26 of June it still blew hard out of the south, and broke the ice whereunto we
were fast in peeces, and we thereby draue into the sea, and could get no more to the
fast ice, whereby we were in a thousand dangers to be all cast away; and driuing in
y<sup>t</sup> sort in the sea, we rowed as <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>much as we could, but we could not get neere vnto the land, therefore we hoysed vp
our fock;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13297src" href="#xd33e13297" title="Go to note 731.">731</a> and so made vp with our saile;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13300src" href="#xd33e13300" title="Go to note 732.">732</a> but our fock-mast<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13305src" href="#xd33e13305" title="Go to note 733.">733</a> brake twice in peeces, and then it was worse for vs than before,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13309src" href="#xd33e13309" title="Go to note 734.">734</a> and notwithstanding that there blew a great gale of wind, yet we were forced to hoyse
vp our great sayle,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13316src" href="#xd33e13316" title="Go to note 735.">735</a> but the wind blew so hard into it that if we had not presently taken it in againe
we had sunke in the sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13321src" href="#xd33e13321" title="Go to note 736.">736</a> or else our boate would haue bin filled with water [so that we must have sunk]; for
the water began to leap ouer borde,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13326src" href="#xd33e13326" title="Go to note 737.">737</a> and we were a good way in the sea, at which time the waues went so hollow [and so
short] that it was most fearful, and we thereby saw nothing but death before our eyes,
and euery twinckling of an eye lookt when we should sincke. But God, that had deliuered
us out of so many dangers of death, holpe vs once againe, and contrary to our expectations
sent vs a north-west wind, and so with great danger we got to y<sup>e</sup> fast ice againe. When we were deliuered out of that danger, and knew not where our
other scute<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13334src" href="#xd33e13334" title="Go to note 738.">738</a> was, we sailed one mile [4 miles] along by the fast ice, but found it not, whereby
we were wholy out of heart and in great feare y<sup>t</sup> they were drowned; at which time it was mistie weather. And so sailing along, and
hearing no newes of our other scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13343src" href="#xd33e13343" title="Go to note 739.">739</a> we shot of a musket, w<sup>h</sup> they hearing shot of another, but yet we could not see each other; meane time approaching
nearer to each other, and the weather waxing somewhat cleerer, as we and they shot
once againe, we saw the smoke of their peeces, and at last we met together againe,
and saw them ly fast between driuing and <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>fast ice. And when we got near unto them, we went ouer the ice and holp them to vnlade
the goods out of their scute, and drew it ouer the ice, and with much paine and trouble
brought it into the open water againe; and while they were fast in the ice, we<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13353src" href="#xd33e13353" title="Go to note 740.">740</a> found some wood vpon the land by the sea side, and when we lay by each other we sod<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13360src" href="#xd33e13360" title="Go to note 741.">741</a> some bread and water together and eate it vp warme, which did vs much good.
</p>
<p>The 27<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13365src" href="#xd33e13365" title="Go to note 742.">742</a> of June we set saile with an indifferent gale out of the east, and got a mile [4
miles] aboue the Cape de Nassaw one the west side thereof, and then we had the wind
against vs, and we were forced to take in our sailes and began to rowe. And as we
went along [the firm ice] close by the land, we saw so many sea-horses lying vpon
the ice [more than we had ever seen before] that it was admirable,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13369src" href="#xd33e13369" title="Go to note 743.">743</a> and a great number of birds, at the which we discharged 2 muskets and killed twelue
of them, which we fetcht into our scutes. And rowing in that sort, we had a great
mist, and then we entred into [the] driuing ice, so that we were compelled to make
our scutes fast vnto the fast ice, and to stay there till the weather brake vp,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13374src" href="#xd33e13374" title="Go to note 744.">744</a> the wind being west north-west and right against vs.
</p>
<p>The 28th of June, when the sunne was in the east, we laid all our goods vpon the ice,
and then drew the scutes vpon the ice also, because we were so hardly prest on all
sides with the ice, and the wind came out of the sea vpon the land, and therefore
we were in feare to be wholely inclosed with the ice, and should not be able to get
out thereof againe. And being vpon the ice, we laid sailes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13381src" href="#xd33e13381" title="Go to note 745.">745</a> ouer our scutes, and laie downe to rest, appointing one of our men to keepe watch;
and when the sunne was north there <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>came three beares towards our scutes, wherewith he that kept the watch cried [out
lustily], three beares, three beares; at which noise we leapt out of our boates with
our muskets, that were laden with haile-shot<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13388src" href="#xd33e13388" title="Go to note 746.">746</a> to shoote at birds, and had no time to discharge<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13393src" href="#xd33e13393" title="Go to note 747.">747</a> them, and therefore shot at them therewith; and although that kinde of shot could
not hurt them much yet they ranne away, and in the meane time they gaue vs leisure
to lade our muskets with bullets, <span class="corr" id="xd33e13398" title="Source: aud">and</span> by that meanes we shot one of the three dead, which the other two perceauing ranne
away, but within two houres after they came againe, but when they were almost at vs
and heard us make a noise, they ranne away; at which time the wind was west and west
and by north, which made the ice driue with great force into the east.
</p>
<p>The 29th of June, the sunne being south south-west, the two beares came againe to
the place where the dead beare laie, where one of them tooke the dead beare in his
mouth, and went a great way with it ouer the rugged ice, and then began to eate it;
which we perceauing, shot a musket at her, but she hearing the noise thereof, ran
away, and let the dead beare lie. Then four of vs went thither, and saw that in so
short a time she had eaten almost the halfe of her; [and] we tooke the dead beare
and laid it vpon a high heap of ice, [so] that we might see it out of our scute, that
if the beare came againe we might shoot at her. At which time we tried<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13403src" href="#xd33e13403" title="Go to note 748.">748</a> the great strenght of the beare, that carried the dead bear as lightely in her mouth
as if it had beene nothing, whereas we foure had enough to doe to cary away the halfe
dead beare betweene vs. Then the wind still held west, which draue the ice into the
east.
</p>
<p>The 30 of June in the morning, when the sunne was east and by north, the ice draue
hard eastward by meanes of the west wind, and then there came two beares vpon a <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>peece of ice that draue in the sea, and thought to set vpon vs, and made show as if
they would leape into the water and come to vs, but did nothing, whereby we were of
opinion that they were the same beares that had beene there before; and about the
south-south-east sunne there came an other beare vpon the fast ice, and made [straight]
towards vs; but being neare vs, and hearing vs make a noise, she went away againe.
Then the wind was west-south-west, and the ice began somewhat to falle from the land;
but because it was mistie weather and a hard wind, we durst not put to sea, but staid
for a better opportunitie.
</p>
<p>The 1 of Julie it was indifferent faire weather, with a west-north-west wind; and
in the morning, the sunne being east, there came a beare from the driuing yce and
swam over the water to the fast yce whereon we lay; but when she heard vs she came
no nearer, but ran away. And when the sunne was south-east, the ice came so fast in
towards vs, that all the ice whereon we lay with our scutes and our goods brake and
ran one peece vpon another, whereby we were in no small feare,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13414src" href="#xd33e13414" title="Go to note 749.">749</a> for at that time most of our goods fell into the water. But we with great diligence
drew our scutes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13419src" href="#xd33e13419" title="Go to note 750.">750</a> further vpon the ice towards the land, where we thought to be better defended from
the driuing of the ice, and as we went to fetch our goods we fell into the greatest
trouble that euer we had before, for y<sup>t</sup> we endured so great danger in the sauing thereof, that as we laid hold vpon one peece
thereof the rest sunke downe with the ice, and many times the ice brake vnder our
owne feet; whereby we were wholy discomforted and in a maner cleane out of all hope,
expecting no issue thereof, in such sort that our trouble at that time surmounted
all our former cares and impeachments. And when we thought to draw vp our boates<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13427src" href="#xd33e13427" title="Go to note 751.">751</a> vpon the ice, the ice brake vnder vs, and we were caried away with the scute and
al<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13430src" href="#xd33e13430" title="Go to note 752.">752</a> by <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>the driuing ice; and when we thought to saue the goods the ice brake vnder our feet,
and with that the scute brak in many places, especially y<sup>t</sup> which we had mended;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13441src" href="#xd33e13441" title="Go to note 753.">753</a> as y<sup>e</sup> mast, y<sup>e</sup> mast planke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13452src" href="#xd33e13452" title="Go to note 754.">754</a> and almost all the scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13458src" href="#xd33e13458" title="Go to note 755.">755</a> wherein one of our men that was sick and a chest of mony lay, which we with great
danger of our liues got out from it; for as we were doing it, the ice that was vnder
our feet draue from vs and slid vpon other ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13463src" href="#xd33e13463" title="Go to note 756.">756</a> whereby we were in danger to burst both our armes and our legs. At which time, thinking
y<sup>t</sup> we had been cleane quit of our scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13473src" href="#xd33e13473" title="Go to note 757.">757</a> we beheld each other in pittiful maner, knowing not what we should doe, our liues
depending thereon; but God made so good prouision for vs, y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> peeces of ice draue from each other, wherewith we ran in great haste vnto the scute<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13483src" href="#xd33e13483" title="Go to note 758.">758</a> and drew it to vs again in such case as it was, and layd it vpon the fast ice by
the boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13486src" href="#xd33e13486" title="Go to note 759.">759</a> where it was in more security, which put us unto an exceeding and great and dangerous
labor from the time that the sunne was south-east vntill it was west south-west, and
in al that time we rested not, which made vs extreame weary and wholy out of comfort,
for that it troubled vs sore, and it was much more fearfull vnto vs then at that time
when William Barents dyed; for there we were almost drowned, and that day we lost
(which was sounke in the sea) two barrels of bread, a chest w<sup>t</sup> linnen cloth, a driefat<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13492src" href="#xd33e13492" title="Go to note 760.">760</a> with the sailors [best] clothes, our astron[omi]cale ring, a pack of scarlet cloth,
a runlet of oyle, and some cheeses, and a runlet of wine, which bongd with the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13497src" href="#xd33e13497" title="Go to note 761.">761</a> so that there was not anything thereof saued.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 2 of Julie, the sunne east, there came another beare vnto vs, but we making a
noyse she ran away; and when the sun was west south-west it began to be faire weather.
Then we began to mend our scute<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13505src" href="#xd33e13505" title="Go to note 762.">762</a> with the planks wherewith we had made the buyckmish;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13508src" href="#xd33e13508" title="Go to note 763.">763</a> and while 6 of vs were busied about mending of our scute, the other sixe went further
into the land, to seeke for some wood, and to fetch some stones to lay vpon the ice,
that we might make a fire thereon, therewith to melt our pitch, which we should need
about the scute, as also to see if they could fetch any wood for a mast [for the boat],
which they found with certain stones,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13513src" href="#xd33e13513" title="Go to note 764.">764</a> and brought them where the scutes lay. And when they came to vs againe they shewed
vs that they had found certain wood which had bin clouen,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13518src" href="#xd33e13518" title="Go to note 765.">765</a> and brought some wedges with them wherewith the said wood had been clouen, whereby
it appeared that men had bin there. Then we made all the haste we could to make a
fire, and to melt our pitch, and to do al other things that were necessary to be done
for the repairing of our scute, so that we got it ready againe by that the sunne was
north-east; at which time also we rosted<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13525src" href="#xd33e13525" title="Go to note 766.">766</a> our birds [which we had shot], and made a good meale with them.
</p>
<p>The 3 of July in the morning, the sunne being east, two of our men went to the water,
and there they found two of our oares, our helme sticke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13534src" href="#xd33e13534" title="Go to note 767.">767</a> the pack of scarlet cloth, the chest with linnen cloth, and a hat that fell out of
the driefat,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13539src" href="#xd33e13539" title="Go to note 768.">768</a> whereby we gest<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13544src" href="#xd33e13544" title="Go to note 769.">769</a> that it was broken in peeces; which they perceiuing, tooke as much with them as they
could carry, and came vnto us, showing vs that they had left <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>more goods behind them, whereupon the maister with 5 more of vs went thither, and
drew al the goods vpon the firme ice, y<sup>t</sup> when we went away we might take it with vs; but they could not carry the chest nor
the pack of cloth (that were ful of water) because of their waight, but were forced
to let them stand till we went away, that the water might drop out<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13555src" href="#xd33e13555" title="Go to note 770.">770</a> of them [and we might afterwards fetch them], and so they did.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13560src" href="#xd33e13560" title="Go to note 771.">771</a> The sunne being south-west there came another great beare vnto vs, which the man
that kept watch saw not, and had beene deuoured by her if one of our other men that
lay downe in the ship<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13565src" href="#xd33e13565" title="Go to note 772.">772</a> had not espied her, and called to him that kept watch to looke to himselfe, who therewith
ran away. Meane time the beare was shot into the body, but she escaped; and that time
the wind was east north-east.
</p>
<p>The 4 of July it was so faire cleare weather, that from the time we were first in
Noua Zembla we had not the like. Then wee washt the veluets, that had been wet with
the salt water, in fresh water drawne out of snow, and then dryed them and packt them
vp againe; at which time the wind was west and west south-west.
</p>
<p>The 5 of July it was faire weather, the wind west south-west. The same day dyed John
Franson<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13573src" href="#xd33e13573" title="Go to note 773.">773</a> of Harlem (Claes Adrians<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13578src" href="#xd33e13578" title="Go to note 774.">774</a> nephew, that dyed the same day when William Barents dyed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13583src" href="#xd33e13583" title="Go to note 775.">775</a>)<span class="corr" id="xd33e13586" title="Not in source">,</span> the sunne being then about north north-west; at which time the ice came mightily
driuing in vpon vs, and then sixe of our men went into the land, and there fetcht
some fire-wood to dresse our meate.
</p>
<p>The 6 of July it was misty weather, but about euening it began to cleere vp, and the
wind was south-east, which put vs in some comfort, and yet we lay fast vpon the ice.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 7 of July it was faire weather with some raine, the wind west south-west, and
at euening west and by north. Then wee went to the open water, and there killed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13594src" href="#xd33e13594" title="Go to note 776.">776</a> thirteene birds, which wee tooke vppon a peece of driuing ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13599src" href="#xd33e13599" title="Go to note 777.">777</a> and layd them vpon the fast ice.
</p>
<p>The 8 of July it was close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13606src" href="#xd33e13606" title="Go to note 778.">778</a> misty weather; then we drest the foules<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13611src" href="#xd33e13611" title="Go to note 779.">779</a> which we had killed, which gaue us a princely mealetide.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13614src" href="#xd33e13614" title="Go to note 780.">780</a> In the euening there blew a fresh gale of wind, out of the north-east, which put
vs in great comfort to get from thence.
</p>
<p>The 9 of July, in the morning, the ice began to driue, whereby we got open water on
the land side, and then also the fast ice whereon we lay began to driue; whereupon
the master and y<sup>e</sup> men went to fetch the pack and the chest that stood vpon the ice, to put them into
the scute, and then drew the scutes to the water at least 340 paces, which was hard
for vs to do, in regard that the labour was great and we very weake. And when the
sun was south south-east we set saile with an east wind; but when the sunne was west
we were forced to make towards the fast ice againe, because thereabouts it was not
yet gon;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13624src" href="#xd33e13624" title="Go to note 781.">781</a> y<sup>e</sup> wind being south and came right from the land, whereby we were in good hope that
it would driue awaye, and that we should proceede in our voyage.
</p>
<p>The 10 of July, from the time that the sunne was east north-east till it was east,
we tooke great paines and labour to get through the ice; and at last we got through,
and rowed forth<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13634src" href="#xd33e13634" title="Go to note 782.">782</a> vntill wee happened to fall betweene two great flakes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13639src" href="#xd33e13639" title="Go to note 783.">783</a> of ice, that closed one with the other, <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>so that we could not get through, but were forced to draw the scutes vpon them, and
to vnlade the goods, and then to draw them ouer to the open water on the other side,
and then we must go fetch the goods also to the same place, being at least 110 paces
long, which was very hard for vs; but there was no remedy, for it was but a folly
for vs to thinke of any wearines. And when we were in the open water againe, we rowed
forward as well as we could, but we had not rowed long before we fell betweene two
great flakes of ice, that came driuing one against the other, but by Gods help and
our speedy rowing we got from betweene them before they closed vp, and being through,
we had a hard west wind right in our teeth, so that of force we were constrained to
make towards the fast ice that lay by the shore, and at last with much trouble we
got vnto it. And being there, we thought to row along by the fast ice vnto an island
that we saw before vs; but by reason of the hard contrary wind we could not goe farre,
so that we were compelled to draw the scutes and the goods vpon the ice, to see what
weather<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13646src" href="#xd33e13646" title="Go to note 784.">784</a> God would send vs; but our courages were cooled to see ourselues so often inclosed
in y<sup>e</sup> ice, being in great feare y<sup>t</sup> by meanes of the long and continuall paines (which we were forced to take) we should
loose all our strength, and by that meanes should not long be able to continue or
hold out.
</p>
<p>The 11 of July in the morning as we sate fast vpon the ice, the sunne being north-east,
there came a great beare out of the water running towards vs, but we watcht for her
with three muskets, and when she came within 30 paces of vs we shot all the three
muskets at her and killed her outright, so that she stirred not a foote, and we might
see the fat run out at the holes of her skinne, that was shot in with the muskets,
swimme vpon the water like oyle; and [she] so driving<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13660src" href="#xd33e13660" title="Go to note 785.">785</a> dead upon the water, we went vpon a flake of ice to her, and putting a rope about
her neck <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>drew her vp vpon the ice and smit out her teeth; at which time we measured her body,
and found it to be eight foote thick.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13665src" href="#xd33e13665" title="Go to note 786.">786</a> Then we had a west wind with a close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13668src" href="#xd33e13668" title="Go to note 787.">787</a> weather; but when the sunne was south it began to cleere vp; then three of our men
went to the island that lay before vs, and being there they saw the Crosse Island<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13673src" href="#xd33e13673" title="Go to note 788.">788</a> lying west-ward from them, and went thither to see if that sommer there had been
any Russian there, and went thither vpon the fast ice that lay between the two islands;
and being in the island, they could not percieue that any man had beene in it since
we were there. There they got 70 [burrow-ducks’<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13679src" href="#xd33e13679" title="Go to note 789.">789</a>] egges, but when they had them they knew not wherein to carry them; at last one of
them put off his breeches, and tying them fast below, they carried them betweene two
of them, and the third bare the musket; and so [they] came to vs againe, after they
had been twelue hours out, which put vs in no small feare to think what was become
of them. They told vs that they had many times gone vp to the knees in water vpon
the ice betweene both the islands, and it was at least 6 [24] miles to and fro that
they had gone, which made vs wonder how they could indure it, seeing we were all so
weake. With the egges that they had brought we were al wel comforted, and fared like
lords, so that we found some reliefe in our great misery,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13688src" href="#xd33e13688" title="Go to note 790.">790</a> and then we shared our last wine amongst us, whereof euery one had three glasses.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13693src" href="#xd33e13693" title="Go to note 791.">791</a>
</p>
<p>The 12 of July in the morning, when the sunne was east, the wind began to blow east
and east north-east, <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>with misty weather; and at euening six of our men went into the land<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13702src" href="#xd33e13702" title="Go to note 792.">792</a> to seeke certaine stones,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13707src" href="#xd33e13707" title="Go to note 793.">793</a> and found some, but none of the best sort; and comming backe againe, either of them
brought some wood.
</p>
<p>The 13 of July it was a faire day; then seuen of our men went to the firme land to
seeke for more stones, and found some; at which time the wind was south-east.
</p>
<p>The 14 of July it was faire weather with a good south wind, and then the ice began
to driue from the land, whereby we were in good hope to haue an open water; but the
wind turning westerly againe, it lay still [firm]. When the sunne was south-west,
three of our men went to the next island that lay before vs, and there shot a bercheynet,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13715src" href="#xd33e13715" title="Go to note 794.">794</a> which they brought to the scute and gaue it amongst vs, for all our goods were [in]
common.
</p>
<p>The 15 of July it was misty weather; that morning the wind was south-east, but the
sunne being west it began to raine, and the wind turned west and west south-west.
</p>
<p>The 16 of July there came a beare from the firme land that came very neere vnto vs,
by reason that it was as white as snow, whereby at first we could not discerne it
to be a beare, because it shewed so like the snow; but by her stirring at last wee
perceiued her, and as she came neere vnto vs we shot at her and hit her, but she ran
away. That morning the wind was west, and after that againe east north-east, with
close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13723src" href="#xd33e13723" title="Go to note 795.">795</a> weather.
</p>
<p>The 17 of July, about the south south-east sunne, 5 of our men went againe to the
nearest island to see if there appeared any open water, for our long staying there
was no small griefe vnto vs, perceiuing not how we should get from thence; who being
halfe way thither, they found a beare <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>lying behind a peece of ice, which the day before had beene shot by vs, but she hearing
vs went away; but one of our men following her with a boate-hooke, thrust her into
the skinne,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13732src" href="#xd33e13732" title="Go to note 796.">796</a> wherewith the beare rose vp vpon her hinder feet, and as the man thrust at her againe,
she stroke the iron of the boat-hooke in peeces, wherewith the man fell downe vpon
his buttocks. Which our other two men seeing, two of them shot the beare into the
body, and with that she ran away, but the other man went after her with his broken
staffe, and stroke the beare vpon the backe, wherewith the beare turned about against
the man three times one after the other; and then the other two came to her, and shot
her into the body againe, wherewith she sat downe vpon her buttocks, and could scant<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13737src" href="#xd33e13737" title="Go to note 797.">797</a> runne any further; and then they shot once againe, wherewith she fell downe, and
they smot<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13740src" href="#xd33e13740" title="Go to note 798.">798</a> her teeth out of her head. All that day the wind was north-east and east north-east.
</p>
<p>The 18 of July, about the east sunne, three of our men went vp vpon the highest part
of the land, to see if there was any open water in the sea; at which time they saw
much open water, but it was so farre from the land that they were almost out of comfort,
because it lay so farre from the land and the fast ice; being of opinion that we should
not be able to drawe the scutes and the goods so farre thither, because our strengthes
stil began to decrease,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13746src" href="#xd33e13746" title="Go to note 799.">799</a> and the sore labour and paine that we were forced to indure more and more increased.
And comming to our scutes, they brought vs that newes; but we, being compelled thereunto
by necessity, abandoned all wearines and faint heartednes, and determined with our
selues to bring the boates and the goods to the water side, and to row vnto that ice
where we must passe ouer to get to the open water. And when we got to <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>it, we vnladed our scutes, and drewe them first [the one and then the other] ouer
the ice to the open water, and after that the goods, it being at the least 1000 paces;
which was so sore a labour for vs, that as we were in hand therewith we were in a
manner ready to leaue off in the middle thereof, and feared that wee should not goe
through withall; but for that we had gone through so many dangers, we hoped y<sup>t</sup> we should not be faint therin, wishing y<sup>t</sup> it might be y<sup>e</sup> last trouble y<sup>t</sup> we should as then indure, and so w<sup>t</sup> great difficulty got into the open water about the south-west sunne. Then we set
saile till the sunne was west and by south, and presently fell amongst the ice againe,
where we were forced to drawe vp the scutes againe vpon the ice; and being vpon it,
we could see the Crosse Island, which we gest to be about a mile [4 miles] from vs,
the wind then being east and east north-east.
</p>
<p>The 19 of July, lying in that manner vpon the ice, about the east sunne seuen of our
men went to the Crosse Island, and being there they saw great store of open water
in y<sup>e</sup> west, wherewith they much reioyced, and made as great haste as they could to get
to the scutes againe; but before they came away they got a hundred egges, and brought
them away with them. And comming to the scutes, they shewed vs that they had seen
as much open water in the sea as they could decerne; being in good hope that that
would be the last time that they should draw the scutes ouer the ice, and that it
should be no more measured by vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13774src" href="#xd33e13774" title="Go to note 800.">800</a> and in that sort put vs in good comfort. Whereupon we made speede to dresse our egges,
and shared them amongst vs; and presently, the sun being south south-west, we fell
to worke to make all things ready to bring the scutes to the water, which were to
be drawen at least 270<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13779src" href="#xd33e13779" title="Go to note 801.">801</a> paces <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>ouer the ice, which we did with a good<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13785src" href="#xd33e13785" title="Go to note 802.">802</a> courage because we were in good hope that it would be the last time. And getting
to the water, we put to sea, with Gods [merciful] helpe [in his mercy], with an east
and east north-east wind and a good gale,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13791src" href="#xd33e13791" title="Go to note 803.">803</a> so that with the west sun we past by the Crosse Island, which is distant from Cape
de Nassawes 10 [40] miles. And presently after that the ice left vs, and we got cleere
out of it; yet we saw some in the sea, but it troubled vs not; and so we held our
course west and by south, with a good gale of wind<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13796src" href="#xd33e13796" title="Go to note 804.">804</a> out of the east and east north-east, so that we gest that betweene euery mealetide<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13801src" href="#xd33e13801" title="Go to note 805.">805</a> we sailed eighteene [72] miles, wherewith we were exceedingly comforted [and full
of joy], giuing God thanks that he had deliuered [and saved] vs out of so great and
many difficulties (wherein it seemed that we should haue bin ouerwhelmed), hoping
in his mercie that from thence foorth he would [still mercifully<span class="corr" id="xd33e13806" title="Source: )">]</span> ayde vs.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13809src" href="#xd33e13809" title="Go to note 806.">806</a>

<p>The 20 of July, hauing still a good gale,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13818src" href="#xd33e13818" title="Go to note 807.">807</a> about the south-east sunne we past along by the Black Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13823src" href="#xd33e13823" title="Go to note 808.">808</a> which is twelue [48] miles distant from the Crosse Island, and sailed west south-west;
and about the euening with the west sunne we saw the Admirable Island,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13828src" href="#xd33e13828" title="Go to note 809.">809</a> and about the north sunne past along by it, which is distant from the Black Point
eight [32] miles. And passing along by it, we saw about two hundred sea horses lying
upon a flake of ice, and we sayled close by them <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>and draue them from thence, which had almost cost vs deere;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13835src" href="#xd33e13835" title="Go to note 810.">810</a> for they, being mighty strong fishes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13839src" href="#xd33e13839" title="Go to note 811.">811</a> and of great force, swam towards vs (as if they would be reuenged on us for the dispight
that we had don them) round about our scuts<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13846src" href="#xd33e13846" title="Go to note 812.">812</a> with a great noyse, as if they would haue deuoured vs; but we escaped from them by
reason that we had a good gale of wind, yet it was not wisely done of vs to wake sleeping
wolues.
</p>
<p>The 21 of July we past by Cape Pluncio<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13851src" href="#xd33e13851" title="Go to note 813.">813</a> about the east north-east sunne, which lyeth west south-west eight [32] miles from
y<sup>e</sup> Admirable Island;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13859src" href="#xd33e13859" title="Go to note 814.">814</a> and with the good gale y<sup>t</sup> we had, about y<sup>e</sup> south-west sun we sailed by Langenes, 9 [36] miles from Cape Pluncio; there the land
reacheth most south-west, and we had a good<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13869src" href="#xd33e13869" title="Go to note 815.">815</a> north-east winde.
</p>
<p>The 22 of July, we hauing so good a gale of wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13876src" href="#xd33e13876" title="Go to note 816.">816</a> when we came to Cape de Cant,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13881src" href="#xd33e13881" title="Go to note 817.">817</a> there we went on land to seeke for some birds and egs, but we found none; so we sayled
forwards. But after y<sup>t</sup>, about y<sup>e</sup> south sun, we saw a clift<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13891src" href="#xd33e13891" title="Go to note 818.">818</a> y<sup>t</sup> was ful of birds; thither we sailed, and casting stones at them, we killed 22 birds
and got fifteene egges, which one of our men fetcht from the clift, and if we would
haue stayed there any longer we might haue taken a hundred or two hundred birds at
least; but because the maister was somewhat further into sea-ward then we and stayed
for vs, and for that we would not loose that faire fore-wind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13900src" href="#xd33e13900" title="Go to note 819.">819</a> we [speedily] sailed forwards [close] a long by the land; and about the south-west
sunne we came to another point, <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>where we got [about] a hundred [and] twenty fiue birds, which we tooke with our hands
out of their neasts, and some we killed with stones and made them fal downe into the
water; for it is a thing certaine y<sup>t</sup> those birds neuer vsed to see men, and that no man had euer sought or vsed to take
them, for else they would haue flowne away,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13910src" href="#xd33e13910" title="Go to note 820.">820</a> and that they feared no body but the foxes and other wilde beastes, that could not
clime up the high clifts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13915src" href="#xd33e13915" title="Go to note 821.">821</a> and that therefore they had made their nests thereon, where they were out of feare
of any beastes comming vnto them; for we were in no small daunger of breaking of our
legges and armes, especially as we came downe againe, because the clift was so high
and so stepe. Those birds had euery one but one egge in their neasts, and that lay
vpon the bare clift without any straw or other [soft] thing vnder them, which is to
be wondred at to thinke how they could breed<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13919src" href="#xd33e13919" title="Go to note 822.">822</a> their young ones in so great cold; but it is to be thought and beleeued that they
therfore sit but vpon one egge, that so the heat which they giue in breeding so many,
[having so much more power,] may be wholy giuen vnto one egge, and by that meanes
it hath all the heat of the birde vnto it selfe, [and is not divided among many eggs
at the same time]. And there also we found many egges, but most of them were foule
and bad. And when we left them,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13922src" href="#xd33e13922" title="Go to note 823.">823</a> the wind fell flat against vs and blew [a strong breeze from the] north-west, and
there also we had much ice, and we tooke great paines to get from the ice, but we
could not get aboue it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13927src" href="#xd33e13927" title="Go to note 824.">824</a> And at last by lauering<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13930src" href="#xd33e13930" title="Go to note 825.">825</a> we fell into the ice; and being there we saw much open water<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13933src" href="#xd33e13933" title="Go to note 826.">826</a> towards the land, whereunto we made as well as we could. But our maister, (that was
[with his boat] more to <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>sea ward,) perceiuing vs to be in the ice, thought we had gotten some hurt, and lauered
to and againe along by the ice; but at last seeing that we sailed therein,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13941src" href="#xd33e13941" title="Go to note 827.">827</a> he was of opinion that we saw some open water,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13946src" href="#xd33e13946" title="Go to note 828.">828</a> and that we made towards it (as it was true), and therefore he wound also towards
vs and came to land by us, where we found a good hauen and lay safe almost from all
winds, and he came thither about two houres after vs. There we went on land, and got
some eggs and [picked up] some wood to make a fire, wherewith we made ready<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13951src" href="#xd33e13951" title="Go to note 829.">829</a> the birds that we had taken; at which time we had a north-west wind with close<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13956src" href="#xd33e13956" title="Go to note 830.">830</a> weather.
</p>
<p>The 23 of July it was darke and mistie weather, with a north wind, whereby we were
forced to lye still in that creeke or hauen: meanetime some of our men went on land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13963src" href="#xd33e13963" title="Go to note 831.">831</a> to seeke for some egges and [perchance also for] stones,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13968src" href="#xd33e13968" title="Go to note 832.">832</a> but found not many, but a reasonable number of good stones.
</p>
<p>The 24 of July it was faire weather, but the wind still northerly, whereby we were
forced to lye still; and about noone we tooke the higth of y<sup>e</sup> sun with our astrolabium, and found it to be eleuated aboue the horizon 37 degrees
and 20 min., his declination 20 degrees and 10 minutes, which substracted from y<sup>e</sup> higth aforesaid rested 17 degrees and 10 minutes, which taken from 90 degrees, the
higth of the Pole was 73 degrees and 10 minutes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13981src" href="#xd33e13981" title="Go to note 833.">833</a> And for y<sup>t</sup> we lay stil there, some of our men went often times on land to seeke stones, and
found some that were as good as euer any that we found.
</p>
<p>The 25 of July it was darke misty weather, the wind north, but we were forced to ly
still because it blew so hard.
</p>
<p>The 26 of July it began to be faire weather, which we had <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>not had for certaine<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e13998src" href="#xd33e13998" title="Go to note 834.">834</a> daies together, the wind still north; and about the south sunne we put to sea, but
it was so great a creeke that we were forced to put foure [16] miles into the sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14001src" href="#xd33e14001" title="Go to note 835.">835</a> before wee could get about<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14006src" href="#xd33e14006" title="Go to note 836.">836</a> the point thereof; and it was most in<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14009src" href="#xd33e14009" title="Go to note 837.">837</a> the wind, so that it was midnight before wee got aboue it, sometimes sayling and
sometimes rowing; and hauing past it, we stroke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14013src" href="#xd33e14013" title="Go to note 838.">838</a> our sailes and rowed along by the land.
</p>
<p>The 27 of July it was faire cleare weather, so that we rowed all that day through
the broken ice along by the land, the wind being north-west; and at evening, about
the west sunne, we came to a place where there ran a great streame,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14018src" href="#xd33e14018" title="Go to note 839.">839</a> whereby we thought that we were about Constinsarke;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14023src" href="#xd33e14023" title="Go to note 840.">840</a> for we saw a great creeke, and we were of opinion y<sup>t</sup> it went through to the Tartarian Sea.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14030src" href="#xd33e14030" title="Go to note 841.">841</a> Our course was most south-west: about the north sunne we past along by the Crosse
Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14037src" href="#xd33e14037" title="Go to note 842.">842</a> and sailed between the firme land and an island, and then went south south-east with
a north-west wind, and made good speed, the maister with y<sup>e</sup> scute being a good way before us; but when he had gotten about y<sup>e</sup> point of the island he staied for vs, and there we lay [some time] by y<sup>e</sup> clifts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14052src" href="#xd33e14052" title="Go to note 843.">843</a> hoping to take some birds, but got none; at which time we had sailed from Cape de
Cant along by Constinsarke to the Crosse Point 20 [80] miles, our course south south-east,
the wind north-west.
</p>
<p>The 28 of July it was faire weather, with a north-east <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>wind; then we sailed along by the land, and with the south-west sunne got before S.
Laurence Bay, or Sconce Point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14060src" href="#xd33e14060" title="Go to note 844.">844</a> and sayled south south-east 6 [24] miles; and being there, we found two Russians
lodgies<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14065src" href="#xd33e14065" title="Go to note 845.">845</a> or ships beyond the Point, wherewith we were [on the one hand] not a little comforted
to thinke that we were come to the place where we found men, but were [on the other
hand] in some doubt of them because they were so many, for at that time wee sawe at
least 30 men, and knew not what [sort of persons] they were [whether savages or other
foreigners<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14068src" href="#xd33e14068" title="Go to note 846.">846</a>]. There with much paine and labour we got to the land, which they perceiuing, left
off their worke and came towards vs, but without any armes; and wee also went on shore,
as many as were well,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14075src" href="#xd33e14075" title="Go to note 847.">847</a> for diuers of vs were very ill at ease and weake by reason of a great scouring in
their bodies.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14081src" href="#xd33e14081" title="Go to note 848.">848</a> And when wee met together wee saluted each other in friendly wise, they after theirs,
and we after our manner. And when we were met, both they and we lookt each other stedfastly
[and pitifully] in the face, for that some of them knew vs, and we them to bee the
same men which the yeare before, when we past through the Weigats, had been in our
ship;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14086src" href="#xd33e14086" title="Go to note 849.">849</a> at which time we perceiued y<sup>t</sup> they were abasht and wondered at vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14092src" href="#xd33e14092" title="Go to note 850.">850</a> to remember that at that time we were so well furnished with a [splendid] great ship,
that was exceedingly prouided of all things necessary, and then to see vs so leane
and bare,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14097src" href="#xd33e14097" title="Go to note 851.">851</a> and with so small [open] scutes into that country. And amongst them there were two
that in friendly manner clapt y<sup>e</sup> master and me upon the shoulder, as knowing vs since y<sup>e</sup> [former] voiage: for there was none of all our men that was as then in <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>that voiage<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14111src" href="#xd33e14111" title="Go to note 852.">852</a> but we two onley; and [they] asked vs for our crable,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14116src" href="#xd33e14116" title="Go to note 853.">853</a> meaning our ship, and we shewed them by signes as well as we could (for we had no
interpreter) that we had lost our ship in the ice; wherewith they sayd <i>Crable pro pal</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14122src" href="#xd33e14122" title="Go to note 854.">854</a> which we vnderstood to be, Haue you lost your ship? and we made answere, <i>Crable pro pal</i>, which was as much as to say, that we had lost our ship. And many more words we could
not vse, because we vnderstood not each other. Then they made shew<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14135src" href="#xd33e14135" title="Go to note 855.">855</a> to be sorry for our losse and to be grieued that we the yeare before had beene there
with so many ships, and then to see vs in so simple manner,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14138src" href="#xd33e14138" title="Go to note 856.">856</a> and made vs signes that then they had drunke wine in our ship, and asked vs what
drinke we had now; wherewith one of our men went into the scute<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14143src" href="#xd33e14143" title="Go to note 857.">857</a> and drew some water, and let them taste thereof; but they shakt their heads, and
said <i>No dobbre</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14148src" href="#xd33e14148" title="Go to note 858.">858</a> that is, it is not good. Then our master went neerer vnto them and shewed them his
mouth, to giue them to vnderstand that we were troubled with a loosnesse in our bellies,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14159src" href="#xd33e14159" title="Go to note 859.">859</a> and to know if they could giue vs any councel to help it; but they thought we made
shew that we had great hunger, wherewith one of them went unto their lodging<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14164src" href="#xd33e14164" title="Go to note 860.">860</a> and fetcht a round rie loafe weighing about 8 pounds, with some smoked<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14171src" href="#xd33e14171" title="Go to note 861.">861</a> foules, which we accepted thankfully, and gaue them in exchange <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>halfe a dozen of muschuyt.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14178src" href="#xd33e14178" title="Go to note 862.">862</a> Then our master led two of the chiefe of them with him into his scute, and gaue them
some of the wine that we had, being almost a gallon,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14186src" href="#xd33e14186" title="Go to note 863.">863</a> for it was so neere out. And while we staied there we were very familiar with them,
and went to the place where they lay, and sod some of our mischuyt<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14192src" href="#xd33e14192" title="Go to note 864.">864</a> with water by their fire, that we might eate some warme thing downe into our bodies.
And we were much comforted to see the Russians, for that in thirteene moneths time
[since] that we departed from John Cornelison<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14195src" href="#xd33e14195" title="Go to note 865.">865</a> we had not seene any man, but onely monsterous and cruell<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14198src" href="#xd33e14198" title="Go to note 866.">866</a> wild beares; for that<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14203src" href="#xd33e14203" title="Go to note 867.">867</a> as then we were in some comfort, to see that we had liued so long to come in company
of men againe, and therewith we said vnto each other, now we hope that it will fall
out better with vs, seeing we haue found men againe, thanking God with all our hearts,
that he had beene so gracious and mercifull vnto vs, to giue vs life vntill that time.
</p>
<p>The 29 of July it was reasonable faire weather, and that morning the Russians began
to make preparation to be gone and to set saile; at which time they digd certaine
barrels with traine oile out of the sieges,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14210src" href="#xd33e14210" title="Go to note 868.">868</a> which they had buried there, and put it into their ships; and we not knowing whither
they would go, saw them saile towards y<sup>e</sup> Weigats: at which time also we set saile and followed after them. But they sayling
before vs, and we following them along by the land, the weather being close and misty,
we lost the sight of them, and knew not whether they put into any creeke or sayled
forward; but we held on our course south south-east, with a north-west wind, and then
south-east, betweene [the] two islands, vntill we were inclosed <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>with ice againe and saw no open water, whereby we supposed that they were about the
Weigats, and that the north-west wind had driuen the ice into that creeke. And being
so inclosed w<sup>t</sup> ice, and saw no open water before vs, but with great labour and paines we went back
againe to the two islands aforesaid, and there about the north-east sunne we made
our scutes fast at one of the islands, for as then it began to blowe hard[er and harder].
</p>
<p>The 30 of July lying at anchor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14225src" href="#xd33e14225" title="Go to note 869.">869</a> the wind still blew [just as stiff from the] north-west, with great store of raine
and a sore storme, so that although we had couered our scutes with our sailes, yet
we could not lye dry, which was an vnaccustomed thing vnto vs: for we had had no raine
in long time before, and yet we were forced to stay there all that day.
</p>
<p>The 31 of July, in the morning, about the north-east sunne, we rowed from that island
to another island, whereon there stood two crosses, whereby we thought that some men
had laine there about trade of merchandise, as the other Russians that we saw before
had done, but we found no man there; the wind as then being north-west, whereby the
ice draue still towards the Weigats.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14232src" href="#xd33e14232" title="Go to note 870.">870</a> There, to our great good, we went on land, for in that island we found great store
of leple leaues,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14235src" href="#xd33e14235" title="Go to note 871.">871</a> which serued vs exceeding well; and it seemed that God had purposely sent vs thither,
for as then we had many sicke men, and most of vs were so troubled with a scouring
in our bodies, and were thereby become so weake, that we could hardly row, but by
meanes of those leaues we were healed thereof: for that as soone as we had eaten them
we were presently eased and healed, whereat we could not choose but wonder,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14242src" href="#xd33e14242" title="Go to note 872.">872</a> and therefore we gave God <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>great thanks for that and for many other his mercies shewed vnto vs, by his great
and vnexpected ayd lent vs in that our dangerous voyage. And so, as I sayd before,
we eate them by whole handfuls together, because in Holland wee had heard much spoken
of their great force, and as then found it to be much more than we expected.
</p>
<p>The 1 of August the wind blew hard north-west, and the ice, that for a while had driuen
towards the entry of the Weigats, stayed and draue no more, but the sea went very
hollow,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14252src" href="#xd33e14252" title="Go to note 873.">873</a> whereby we were forced to remoue our scutes on the other side of the island; to defend
them from the waues of the sea. And lying there, we went on land againe to fetch more
leple leaues,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14255src" href="#xd33e14255" title="Go to note 874.">874</a> whereby wee had bin so wel holpen, and stil more and more recouered our healths,
and in so short time that we could not choose but wonder thereat; so that as then
some of vs could eate bisket againe, which not long before they could not do.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14258src" href="#xd33e14258" title="Go to note 875.">875</a>
</p>
<p>The 2 of August it was dark misty weather, the wind stil blowing stiffe north-west;
at which time our victuals began to decrease, for as then we had nothing but a little
bread and water, and some of vs a little cheese, which made vs long sore to be gone
from thence, specially in regard of our hunger, whereby our weake members began to
be much weaker, and yet we were forced to labour sore, which were two great contraries;
for it behoued vs rather to haue our bellies full, that so we might be the stronger
to endure our labour; but patience was our point of trust.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14263src" href="#xd33e14263" title="Go to note 876.">876</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 3 of August, about the north sun, the weather being somewhat better, we agreed
amongst our selues to leaue Noua Zembla and to crosse ouer to Russia; and so committing
our selues to God, we set saile with a north-west wind, and sailed south south-west
till the sun was east, and then we entred into ice againe, which put vs in great feare,
for we had crost ouer and left the ice vpon Noua Zembla,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14275src" href="#xd33e14275" title="Go to note 877.">877</a> and were in good hope y<sup>t</sup> we should not meet with any ice againe in so short space. At which time, being [thus]
in the ice, with calme weather, whereby our sailes could doe vs no great good, we
stroke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14285src" href="#xd33e14285" title="Go to note 878.">878</a> our sailes and began to row againe, and at last we rowed clean through the ice,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14288src" href="#xd33e14288" title="Go to note 879.">879</a> not without great and sore labour, and about the south-west sunne got cleere thereof
and entred into the large sea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14293src" href="#xd33e14293" title="Go to note 880.">880</a> where we saw no ice; and then, what with sailing and rowing, we had made 20 [80]
miles. And so sailing forwards we thought to aproch neere vnto the Russian coast,
but about the north-west sunne we entred into the ice againe, and then it was very
cold, wherewith our hearts became very heauy, fearing that it would alwaies continew
in that sort, and that we should neuer be freed thereof. And for that our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14299src" href="#xd33e14299" title="Go to note 881.">881</a> could not make so good way nor was not able to saile aboue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14304src" href="#xd33e14304" title="Go to note 882.">882</a> the point of ice, we were compelled to enter into the ice, for that being in it we
perceiued open sea beyond it; but the hardest matter was to get into it, for it was
very close, but at last we found a meanes to enter, and got in. And being entred,
it was somewhat better, and in the end with great paine and labour we got into the
open water. Our maister, that was in the scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14307src" href="#xd33e14307" title="Go to note 883.">883</a> which sailed better than our boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14310src" href="#xd33e14310" title="Go to note 884.">884</a> got aboue<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14313src" href="#xd33e14313" title="Go to note 885.">885</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>the point of the ice, and was in some feare that we were inclosed with <span class="corr" id="xd33e14319" title="Source: ye">y<sup>e</sup></span> ice; but God sent vs the meanes to get out from it as soone as he could saile about
the point thereof,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14329src" href="#xd33e14329" title="Go to note 886.">886</a> and so we met together againe.
</p>
<p>The 4 of August, about the south-east sunne, being gotten out of the ice, we sailed
forward with a north-west wind, and held our course [mostly] southerly; and when the
sunne was [about] south, at noone time, we saw the coast of Russia lying before vs,
whereat we were exceeding glad; and going neerer vnto it, we stroke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14336src" href="#xd33e14336" title="Go to note 887.">887</a> our sailes and rowed on land, and found it to be very low land, like a bare strand
that might be flowed ouer with the water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14339src" href="#xd33e14339" title="Go to note 888.">888</a> There we lay till the sunne was south-west; but perceiuing that there we could not
much further our selues, hauing as then sailed from the point of Noua Zembla (from
whence we put off) thither ful 30 [120] miles, we sailed forward along by the coast
of Russia with an indifferent gale of wind, and when the sunne was north we saw another
Russian iolle or ship,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14342src" href="#xd33e14342" title="Go to note 889.">889</a> which we sailed vnto to speake with them; and being hard by them, they came al aboue
hatches,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14347src" href="#xd33e14347" title="Go to note 890.">890</a> and we cried vnto them, <i>Candinaes, Candinaes</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14355src" href="#xd33e14355" title="Go to note 891.">891</a> whereby we asked them if we were about Candinaes, but they cryed againe and sayd,
<i>Pitzora, Pitzora</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14361src" href="#xd33e14361" title="Go to note 892.">892</a> to shew vs that we were thereabouts. And for y<sup>t</sup> we sailed along by the coast, where it was very drie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14368src" href="#xd33e14368" title="Go to note 893.">893</a> supposing that we held our course west <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>and by north, that so we might get beyond the point of Candinaes, we were wholy deceiued
by our compas, that stood vpon a chest bound with yron bands, which made vs vary at
least 2 points, whereby we were much more southerly then we thought our course had
bin, and also farre more easterly, for we thought verily that we had not bin farre
from Candinaes, and we were three daies sailing from it, as after we perceiued;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14376src" href="#xd33e14376" title="Go to note 894.">894</a> and for that we found our selues to be so much out of our way, we stayed there all
night til day appeared.
</p>
<p>The 5 of August, lying there, one of our men went on shore, and found the land further
in to be greene and ful of trees,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14381src" href="#xd33e14381" title="Go to note 895.">895</a> and from thence called to vs to bid vs bring our peeces on shore, saying that there
was wild deere to be killed,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14386src" href="#xd33e14386" title="Go to note 896.">896</a> which made vs exceeding glad, for then our victuales were almost spent, and we had
nothing but some broken bread,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14391src" href="#xd33e14391" title="Go to note 897.">897</a> whereby we were wholy out of comfort, and<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14396src" href="#xd33e14396" title="Go to note 898.">898</a> some of vs were of opinion that we should leaue the scutes and goe further into the
land, or else (they said) we should all die with hunger, for that many daies before
we were forced to fast, and hunger was a sharpe sword which we could hardly endure
any longer.
</p>
<p>The 6 of August the weather began to be somewhat better; at which time we determined
to row forward, because the wind was [dead] against vs, [so] that we might get out
of the creeke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14403src" href="#xd33e14403" title="Go to note 899.">899</a> the wind being east south-east, which was our <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>course as then. And so, hauing rowed about three [12] miles, we could get no further
because it was so full in the wind, and we al together heartlesse and faint, the land
streatching further north-east then we made account it had done,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14410src" href="#xd33e14410" title="Go to note 900.">900</a> whereupon we beheld each other in pittifull manner, for we had great want of victuals,
and knew not how farre we had to saile before we should get any releefe, for al our
victuals was almost consumed.
</p>
<p>The 7 of August, the wind being west north-west, it serued vs well to get out of that
creeke, and so we sailed forward east and by north till we got out of the creeke,
to the place and the point of land where we first had bin, and there made our scutes
fast again; for the north-west wind was right against vs, whereby our mens hearts
and courages were wholy abated, to see no issue how we should get from thence; for
as then sicknesses, hunger, and no meanes to be found how to get from thence, consumed
both our flesh and our bloud; but if we had found any releefe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14415src" href="#xd33e14415" title="Go to note 901.">901</a> it would haue bin better with vs.
</p>
<p>The 8 of August there was no better weather, but still the wind was [dead] against
vs, and we lay a good way one from the other, as we found best place for vs; at which
time there was most dislike<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14423src" href="#xd33e14423" title="Go to note 902.">902</a> in our boate, in regard that some of vs were exceeding hungrie and could not endure
it any longer, but were wholy out of heart still<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14428src" href="#xd33e14428" title="Go to note 903.">903</a> wishing to die.
</p>
<p>The 9 of August it was all one weather, so that the wind blowing contrary we were
forced to lye still and could goe no further, our greefe still increasing more and
more. At last, two of our men went out of the scute wherein the maister was, which
we perceiuing two of our men also landed, and went altogether about a mile [4 miles]
into the countrie,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14435src" href="#xd33e14435" title="Go to note 904.">904</a> and at last saw a banke, by the which there issued <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>a great streame of water,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14442src" href="#xd33e14442" title="Go to note 905.">905</a> which we thought to be the way from whence the Russians came betweene Candinaes and
the firme land of Russia.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14449src" href="#xd33e14449" title="Go to note 906.">906</a> And as our men came backe againe, in the way as they went along they found a dead
sea-horse<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14454src" href="#xd33e14454" title="Go to note 907.">907</a> that stanke exceedingly, which they drew with them to our scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14460src" href="#xd33e14460" title="Go to note 908.">908</a> thinking that they should haue a dainty morsell<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14465src" href="#xd33e14465" title="Go to note 909.">909</a> out of it, because they endured so great hunger; but we [dissuaded them from it,
and] told them that without doubt it would kil us, and that it were better for vs
to endure pouerty and hunger for a time, then to venture vpon it; saying, that seeing
God, who<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14472src" href="#xd33e14472" title="Go to note 910.">910</a> in so many great extremitys had sent vs a happy issue, stil liued and was exceeding
powerfull, we hoped and nothing doubting that he would not altogether forsake vs,
but rather helpe vs when we were most in dispaire.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14477src" href="#xd33e14477" title="Go to note 911.">911</a>
</p>
<p>The 10 of August it was stil a north-west wind, with mistie and darke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14484src" href="#xd33e14484" title="Go to note 912.">912</a> weather, so that we were driuen<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14489src" href="#xd33e14489" title="Go to note 913.">913</a> to lie still; at which time it was no need for vs to aske one another how we fared,
for we could well gesse it by our countenances.
</p>
<p>The 11 of August, in the morning, it was faire calme weather; so that, the sunne being
about north-east, the master sent one of his men to vs to bid vs prepare our selues
to set saile, but we had made our selues ready thereunto before he came, and [had]
began to rowe towards <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>him. At which time, for that I was very weake and no longer able to rowe, as also
for that our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14496src" href="#xd33e14496" title="Go to note 914.">914</a> was harder to rowe then the scute,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14501src" href="#xd33e14501" title="Go to note 915.">915</a> I was set in the scute to guide the helme, and one that was stronger was sent out
of the scute into the boate to rowe in my place, that we might keepe company together;
and so we rowed till y<sup>e</sup> sunne was south, and then we had a good gale of wind out of the south, which made
vs take in our oares, and then we hoised vp our sailes, wherewith we made good way;
but in the euening the wind began to blowe hard, whereby we were forced to take in
our sailes and to rowe towards the land, where we laid our scutes vpon the strand,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14509src" href="#xd33e14509" title="Go to note 916.">916</a> and went on land to seeke for fresh water, but found none. And because we could goe
no further, we laid our sailes ouer the boates to couer vs from the weather; at which
time it began to raine very hard, and at midnight it thundred and lightned, with more
store of raine, where with our company were much disquieted to see that they found
no meanes of releefe, but still entred into further trouble and danger.
</p>
<p>The 12 of August it was faire weather; at which time, the sunne being east, we saw
a Russia lodgie<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14516src" href="#xd33e14516" title="Go to note 917.">917</a> come towards vs with al his sailes vp, wherewith we were not a little comforted,
which we perceauing from the strand, where we laie with our scutes, we desired the
master that we might goe<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14521src" href="#xd33e14521" title="Go to note 918.">918</a> vnto him to speake with him, and to get some victuales of them; and to that end we
made as much haste as we could to launche out our scutes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14526src" href="#xd33e14526" title="Go to note 919.">919</a> and sailed toward them. And when we got to them, the master went into the lodgie
to aske them how farre we had to Candinaes, which we could not well learne of them
because we understood them not. They held vp their fiue fingers vnto vs, but we knew
not <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>what they ment thereby, but after we perceaued that thereby they would show us that
there stood five crosses upon it; and they brought their compas out and shewed vs
that it lay north-west from us, which our compas also shewed vs, which reckning also
we had made; but when we saw we could haue no better intelligence from them, the master
went further into their ship, and pointed to a barrell of fish y<sup>t</sup> he saw therein, making signes to know whether they would sel it vnto vs, showing
them a peece of 8 royles;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14537src" href="#xd33e14537" title="Go to note 920.">920</a> which they vnderstanding, gave vs 102 fishes, with some cakes which they had made
of meale when they sod<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14540src" href="#xd33e14540" title="Go to note 921.">921</a> their fishe. And about the south sunne we left them, being glad that we had gotten
some victuales, for long before we had had but two<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14543src" href="#xd33e14543" title="Go to note 922.">922</a> ounces of bread a day with a little water, and nothing else, and with that we were
forced to comfort our selues as well as we could. The fishes we shared amongst vs
equally, to one as much as another,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14548src" href="#xd33e14548" title="Go to note 923.">923</a> without any difference. And when we had left them, we held our course west and by
north, with a south and a south and by east wind; and when the sunne was west south
west it began to thunder and raine, but it continued not long, for shortly after the
weather began to cleare vp againe; and passing forward in that sort, we saw the sunne
in our common compas go downe north and by west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14553src" href="#xd33e14553" title="Go to note 924.">924</a>
</p>
<p>The 13 of August we [again] had the wind against vs, being west south-west, and our
course was west and by north, whereby we were forced to put to the shore againe, <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>where two of our men went on the land to see how it laie, and whether the point of
Candinaes reacht not out from thence into the sea, for we gest that we were not farre
from it. Our men comming againe, showed vs that they had seene a house vpon the land,
but no man in it, and said further that they could not perceaue but that it was the
point of Candinaes that we had seene, wherewith we were somewhat comforted, and went
into our scutes againe, and rowed along by the land; at which time hope made vs to
be of good comfort, and procured vs to doe more then we could well haue done, for
our liues and maintenance consisted therein. And in that sort rowing along by the
land, we saw an other Russian iollie<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14568src" href="#xd33e14568" title="Go to note 925.">925</a> lying vpon the shore, which was broken in peeces; but we past by it, and a little
after that we saw a house at the water-side, whereunto some of our men went, wherein
also they found no man, but only an ouen. And when they came againe to the scute,
they brought some leple leaues<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14573src" href="#xd33e14573" title="Go to note 926.">926</a> with them, which they had found<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14578src" href="#xd33e14578" title="Go to note 927.">927</a> as they went. And as we rowed along by the point, we had [again] a good gale of winde<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14583src" href="#xd33e14583" title="Go to note 928.">928</a> out of the east, at which time we hoised vp our sailes and sailed foreward. And after
noone, about the south-west sunne, we perceaued that the point which we had seene
laie south-ward, whereby we were fully perswaded that it was the point of Candinaes,
from whence we ment<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14589src" href="#xd33e14589" title="Go to note 929.">929</a> to saile ouer the mouth of the White Sea;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14592src" href="#xd33e14592" title="Go to note 930.">930</a> and to that end we borded each other and deuided our candles and all other things
that we should need amongst vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14595src" href="#xd33e14595" title="Go to note 931.">931</a> to helpe our <span class="corr" id="xd33e14600" title="Source: seules">selues</span> therewith, and so put of from the land, thinking to <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>passe ouer the White Sea to the coast of Russia.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14605src" href="#xd33e14605" title="Go to note 932.">932</a> And sailing in that sort with a good winde, about midnight there rose a great storme
out of the north, wherewith we stroke saile and made it shorter;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14613src" href="#xd33e14613" title="Go to note 933.">933</a> but our other boate, that was harder vnder saile,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14618src" href="#xd33e14618" title="Go to note 934.">934</a> (knowing not that we had lessened our sailes,) sailed foreward, whereby we straied
one from the other, for then it was very darke.
</p>
<p>The 14 of August in the morning, it being indifferent good weather with a south-west
wind, we sailed west north-west, and then it began to cleare vp, so that we [just]
saw our [other] boate, and did what we could to get vnto her, but we could not, because
it began to be mistie weather againe; and therefore we said unto each other, let vs
hold on our course, we shal finde them wel enough on the north coast, when we are
past the White Sea.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14625src" href="#xd33e14625" title="Go to note 935.">935</a> Our course was west north-west, the wind being south-west and by west, and about
the south-west sunne, we could get no further, because the wind fel contrary, whereby
we were forced to strike our sailes and to row forward; and in that sort, rowing till
the sunne was west, there blew an indifferent gale of wind<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14632src" href="#xd33e14632" title="Go to note 936.">936</a> out of the east, and therewith we set saile (and yet we rowed with two oares) till
the sunne was north north-west, and then the wind began to blow somewhat stronger
east and east south-east, at which time we tooke in our oares and sailed forward west
north-west.
</p>
<p>The 15 of August wee saw the sunne rise east north-east, wherevpon we thought that
our compasse varied somewhat;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14639src" href="#xd33e14639" title="Go to note 937.">937</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>and when the sunne was east it was calme weather againe, wherewith we were forced
to take in our sailes and to row againe, but it was not long before wee had a gale
of winde<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14666src" href="#xd33e14666" title="Go to note 938.">938</a> out of the south-east, and then we hoysed vp our sailes againe, and went forward
west and by south. And sayling in that manner with a good forewind,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14671src" href="#xd33e14671" title="Go to note 939.">939</a> when the sunne was south we saw land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14676src" href="#xd33e14676" title="Go to note 940.">940</a> thinking that as then we had beene on the west side of the White Sea beyond Cardinaes;
and being close vnder the land, we saw sixe Russian lodgies<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14680src" href="#xd33e14680" title="Go to note 941.">941</a> lying there, to whom we sailed and spake with them, asking them how far wee were
from Kilduin;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14683src" href="#xd33e14683" title="Go to note 942.">942</a> but although they vnderstood vs not well, yet they made vs such signes that we vnderstood
by them that we were still farre from thence, and that we were yet on the east side
of Candinaes. And with that they stroke their hands together,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14688src" href="#xd33e14688" title="Go to note 943.">943</a> thereby signifying y<sup>t</sup> we must first passe ouer the White Sea, and that our scutes were too little to doe
it, and that it would be ouer great daunger for vs to passe ouer it with so small
scutes, and that Candinaes was still north-west from vs. Then wee asked them for some
bread, and they gaue vs a loafe, which [dry as it was] wee eate hungerly vp as wee
were rowing, but wee would not beleeue them that we were still on the east side of
<span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: Candinaes">Cardinaes</span>, for we thought verily that wee had past ouer the White Sea. And when we left them,
we rowed along by the land, the wind beeing north; and about the north-west sunne
we had a good wind againe from the south-east, and therewith we sayled along by the
shore, and saw a great Russian lodgie lying on the starreboord from vs, which we thought
came out of the White Sea.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 16 of August in the morning, sayling forward north-west, wee perceiued that we
were in a creeke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14702src" href="#xd33e14702" title="Go to note 944.">944</a> and so made towards y<sup>e</sup> Russian lodgie which we had seene on our starreboord, which at last with great labour
and much paine we got vnto; and comming to them about the south-east sunne, with a
hard wind, we asked them how farre we were from Sembla de Cool<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14710src" href="#xd33e14710" title="Go to note 945.">945</a> or Kilduin; but they shooke their heads, and shewed us that we were on the east side
of Zembla de Candinaes<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14719src" href="#xd33e14719" title="Go to note 946.">946</a> but we would not beleeue them. And then we asked them [for] some victuals, wherewith
they gaue vs certaine plaice, for the which the maister gaue them a peece of money,
and [we] sailed from them againe, to get out of that hole where wee were,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14726src" href="#xd33e14726" title="Go to note 947.">947</a> as it reacht into the sea; but they perceiuing that we tooke a wrong course and that
the flood was almost past, sent two men vnto vs, in a small boate, with a great loafe
of bread, which they gaue vs, and made signes vnto vs to come aboord of their ship
againe,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14732src" href="#xd33e14732" title="Go to note 948.">948</a> for that they intended to haue further speech with vs and to help<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14737src" href="#xd33e14737" title="Go to note 949.">949</a> vs, which we seemed not to refuse and desiring not to be vnthankfull, gaue them a
peece of money and a peece of linnen cloth, but they stayed still by vs, and they
that were in the great lodgie held vp bacon and butter vnto vs, to mooue vs to come
aboord of them againe, and so we did. And being with them, they showed vs that we
were stil on the east side of the point of Candinaes; then we <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>fetcht our card<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14744src" href="#xd33e14744" title="Go to note 950.">950</a> and let them see it, by the which they shewed vs that we were still on the east side
of the White Sea and of Candinaes; which we vnderstanding, were in some doubt with
our selues<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14749src" href="#xd33e14749" title="Go to note 951.">951</a> because we had so great a voiage to make ouer the White Sea, and were in more feare
for our companions that were in the boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14754src" href="#xd33e14754" title="Go to note 952.">952</a> as also y<sup>t</sup> hauing sailed 22 [88] miles along by the Russian coast,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14763src" href="#xd33e14763" title="Go to note 953.">953</a> we had gotten no further, but were then to saile ouer the mouth of the White Sea
with so small prouision; for which cause the master bought of y<sup>e</sup> Russians three sacks w<sup>t</sup> meale, two flitches and a halfe of bacon, a pot of Russia butter, and a runlet of
honny, for prouision for vs and our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14774src" href="#xd33e14774" title="Go to note 954.">954</a> when we should meet with it againe. And for y<sup>t</sup> in the meane time the flood was past, we sailed with the [beginning of the] ebbe
out of the aforesaid creeke<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14783src" href="#xd33e14783" title="Go to note 955.">955</a> where the Russians boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14788src" href="#xd33e14788" title="Go to note 956.">956</a> came to vs, and entred into the sea with a good south-east wind, holding our course
north north-west; and there we saw a point that reacht out into the sea, which we
thought to be Candinaes, but we sailed still forward, and the land reached north-west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14793src" href="#xd33e14793" title="Go to note 957.">957</a> In the euening, the sunne being north-west, when we saw that we did not much good
with rowing, and that the streame<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14798src" href="#xd33e14798" title="Go to note 958.">958</a> was almost past, we lay still, and sod<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14803src" href="#xd33e14803" title="Go to note 959.">959</a> a pot full of water and meale, which tasted exceeding well, because we had put some
bacon fat and honny into it, so that we thought it to be a feastiuall day<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14806src" href="#xd33e14806" title="Go to note 960.">960</a> with vs, but still our minds ran vpon our boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14816src" href="#xd33e14816" title="Go to note 961.">961</a> because we knew not where it was.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 17 of August, lying at anchor, in the morning at breake of day we saw a Russian
lodgie that came sayling out of the White Sea, to whom we rowed, that we might haue
some instruction<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14824src" href="#xd33e14824" title="Go to note 962.">962</a> from him; and when we boorded him, without asking or speaking vnto him, he gaue vs
a loafe of bread, and by signes shewed vs as well as he could that he had seene our
companions, and that there was seuen men in the boate; but we not knowing well what
they sayd, neither yet beleeuing them, they made other signes vnto vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14829src" href="#xd33e14829" title="Go to note 963.">963</a> and held vp their seuen fingers and pointed to our scute, thereby shewing that there
were so many men in the boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14834src" href="#xd33e14834" title="Go to note 964.">964</a> and that they had sold them bread, flesh, fish, and other victualls. And while we
staid in their lodgie, we saw a small compasse therein, which we knew that they had
bought<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14839src" href="#xd33e14839" title="Go to note 965.">965</a> of our chiefe boatson,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14844src" href="#xd33e14844" title="Go to note 966.">966</a> which they likewise acknowledged. Then we vnderstanding them well, askt them how
long it was since they saw our boate<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14850src" href="#xd33e14850" title="Go to note 967.">967</a> and whereabouts it was, [and] they made signes vnto vs that it was the day before.
And to conclude, they showed vs great friendship, for the which we thanked them; and
so, being glad of the good newes wee had heard we tooke our leaues of them, much reioycing
that wee heard of our companions welfare, and specially because they had gotten victuals
from the Russians, which was the thing that wee most doubted of, in regard that we
knew what small prouision they had with them. Which done, we rowed as hard as we could,
to try if we might ouertake them, as being still in doubt that they had not prouision
inough, wishing that we had had part of ours: and hauing rowed al that day with great
labour along by the land, about midnight <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>we found a fall of fresh water, and then we went on land to fetch some [water], and
there also we got some leple leaues.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14857src" href="#xd33e14857" title="Go to note 968.">968</a> And as we thought to row forward, we were forced to saile, because the flood was
past,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14860src" href="#xd33e14860" title="Go to note 969.">969</a> and still wee lookt earnestly out for the point of Candinaes, and the fiue crosses,
whereof we had beene instructed by the Russians, but we could not see it.
</p>
<p>The 18 of August in the morning, the sunne being east, [in order to gain time] wee
puled vp our stone (which we vsed in steed of an anchor,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14867src" href="#xd33e14867" title="Go to note 970.">970</a>) and rowed along by the land till the sunne was south, then wee saw a point of land
reaching into the sea, and on it certaine signes of crosses,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14872src" href="#xd33e14872" title="Go to note 971.">971</a> which as we went neerer vnto wee saw perfectly; and when the sunne was west, wee
perceiued that the land reached west and south-west, so that thereby we knew it certainly
to be the point of Candinaes, lying at the mouth of the White Sea, which we were to
crosse, and had long desired to see it. This point is easily to be knowne, hauing
fiue crosses standing vpon it, which are perfectly to be decerned, one the east side
in the south-east, and one the other side in the south-west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14877src" href="#xd33e14877" title="Go to note 972.">972</a> And when we thought to saile from thence to the west side of the White Sea towards
the coast of Norway, we found that one of our runlets of fresh water was almost leakt
out; and for that we had about 40 Dutch [160] miles to saile ouer the sea before we
should get any fresh water, we <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>sought meanes first to row on land to get some, but because the waues went so high
we durst not do it; and so hauing a good north-east wind (which was not for vs too
slack<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14884src" href="#xd33e14884" title="Go to note 973.">973</a>) we set forward in the name of God, and when the sunne was north-west we past the
point,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14890src" href="#xd33e14890" title="Go to note 974.">974</a> and all that night and the next day sailed with a good wind, and [in] all that time
rowed but while three glasses were run out;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14897src" href="#xd33e14897" title="Go to note 975.">975</a> and the next night after ensuing hauing still a good wind, in the morning about the
east north-east sunne we saw land one the west side of the White Sea, which we found
by the rushing of the sea vpon the land before we saw it. And perceiuing it to be
ful of clifts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14900src" href="#xd33e14900" title="Go to note 976.">976</a> and not low sandy ground with same hills<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14905src" href="#xd33e14905" title="Go to note 977.">977</a> as it is on the east side of the White Sea, we assured our selues<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14910src" href="#xd33e14910" title="Go to note 978.">978</a> that we were on y<sup>e</sup> west side of the White Sea, vpon the coast of Lapeland, for the which we thanked
God that he had helped vs to saile over the White Sea in thirty houres, it being forty
Dutch [160] miles at the least, our course being west with a [nice] north-east wind.
</p>
<p>The 20 of August, being not farre from the land, the north-east wind left vs, and
then it began to blow stiffe north-west; at which time, seeing we could not make much
way by sailing forward, we determined to put in betweene certaine clifts, and when
we got close to the land we espied certaine crosses with warders<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14919src" href="#xd33e14919" title="Go to note 979.">979</a> vpon them, whereby we vnderstood that it was a good way,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14924src" href="#xd33e14924" title="Go to note 980.">980</a> and so put into it. And <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>being entred a litle way within it, we saw a great Russian lodgie<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14933src" href="#xd33e14933" title="Go to note 981.">981</a> lying at an anchor, whereunto we rowed as fast as we could, and there also we saw
certaine houses wherein men dwelt. And when we got to the lodgie, we made our selues
fast vnto it,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14938src" href="#xd33e14938" title="Go to note 982.">982</a> and cast our tent ouer the scute, for as then it began to raine. Then we went on
land into the houses that stood vpon the shore, where they showed vs great friendship,
leading vs into their stoawes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14944src" href="#xd33e14944" title="Go to note 983.">983</a> and there dried our wet clothes, and then seething some fish, bade vs sit downe and
eate somewhat with them.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14953src" href="#xd33e14953" title="Go to note 984.">984</a> In those little houses we found thirteene Russians, who euery morning went out [in
two boats] to fish in the sea; whereof two of them had charge ouer the rest. They
liued very poorely, and ordinarily eate nothing but fish and bread.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14958src" href="#xd33e14958" title="Go to note 985.">985</a> At euening, when we prepared our selues to go to our scute againe, they prayed the
maister and me to stay with them in their houses, which the maister thanked them for,
would not do [and went into the boat], but I stayed with them al that night. Besides
those thirteene men, there was two Laplanders more and three women with a child, that
liued very poorely of the ouerplus<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14967src" href="#xd33e14967" title="Go to note 986.">986</a> which the Russians gaue them, as a peece of fish and some fishes heades, which the
Russians threw away and they with great thankfulnesse tooke them vp, so that in respect
of their pouertie [and ill condition] we thought our selues to bee well furnished,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14972src" href="#xd33e14972" title="Go to note 987.">987</a> and yet we had little inough, but as it seemed their ordinary liuing was in that
manner. And we were forced to <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>stay there for that the wind being north-west, it was against vs.
</p>
<p>The 21 of August it rained most part of the day, but not so much after dinner as before.
Then our master brought<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14981src" href="#xd33e14981" title="Go to note 988.">988</a> good store of fresh fish, which we sod,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14986src" href="#xd33e14986" title="Go to note 989.">989</a> and eate our bellies full, which in long time we had not done, and therewith sod
some meale and water in steed of bread, whereby we were well comforted. After noone,
when the raine began to lessen, we went [at times a little] further into the land
and sought for some leple leaues,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14991src" href="#xd33e14991" title="Go to note 990.">990</a> and then we saw two men vpon y<sup>e</sup> hilles, whereupon we said one to the other, hereabouts there must more people dwel,
for there came two men towards vs, but we, regarding them not, went back againe to
our scute and towards the houses. The two men that were vpon the hilles (being some
of our men that were in the [other] boate,) perceauing [also] the Russian lodgie,
came downe the hill towards her to buy<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e14999src" href="#xd33e14999" title="Go to note 991.">991</a> some victuales of them; who being come thither vnawares<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15005src" href="#xd33e15005" title="Go to note 992.">992</a> and hauing no mony about them, they agreed betweene them to put off one of their
paire of breeches, (for that as then we ware two or three paire one ouer the other,)
to sel them for some victuals.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15010src" href="#xd33e15010" title="Go to note 993.">993</a> But when they came downe the hill and were <span class="corr" id="xd33e15015" title="Source: semewhat">somewhat</span> neerer vnto vs, they espied our scute lying by the lodgie, and we as then beheld
them better and knew them; wherewith we reioyced [much on both sides], and shewed
each other of our proceedings and how we had sailed to and fro in great necessity
and hunger and yet they had been in greater necessitie and danger then we, and gaue
God thankes that he had preserued vs aliue and brought vs together againe. And then
we eate something together, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>dranke of the cleare water, such as runneth along by Collen through the Rein,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15020src" href="#xd33e15020" title="Go to note 994.">994</a> and then we agreed that they should come vnto vs, that we might saile together.
</p>
<p>The 22 of August the rest of our men<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15033src" href="#xd33e15033" title="Go to note 995.">995</a> with the boate came unto vs about the east south-east sunne, whereat we much reioyced,
and then we prayed the Russians cooke to bake a sacke of meale for vs and to make
it bread, paying him for it, which he did. And in the meane time, when the fishermen
came with their fishe out of the sea, our maister bought foure cods of them, which
we sod and eate. And while we were at meat, the chiefe of the Russians came vnto vs,
and perceiuing that we had not much bread, he fetcht a loaf and gave it vs, and although
we desired them to sit downe and eate some meat with vs, yet we could by no means
get them to graunt thereunto, because it was their fasting day and for y<sup>t</sup> we had poured butter and fat into our fish; nor we could not get them once to drinke
with us, because our cup was somewhat greasie, they were so superstitious touching
their fasting and religion. Neither would they lend vs any of their cups to drinke
in, least they should likewise be greased. At that time the wind was [constantly]
north-west.
</p>
<p>The 23 of August the cooke began to knead our meale, and made vs bread thereof; which
being don, and the wind and the weather beginning to be somewhat better, we made our
selues ready to depart from thence; at which time, when the Russians came from fishing,
our maister gaue their chiefe commander a good peece of mony<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15043src" href="#xd33e15043" title="Go to note 996.">996</a> in regard of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>frendship that he had shewed vs, and gaue some what also to the cooke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15052src" href="#xd33e15052" title="Go to note 997.">997</a> for the which they yielded vs great thankes. At which time, the chiefe of the Russians
[having before] desired our maister to giue him some gunpowder, which he did, [and
he also thanked him much.] And when we were ready to saile from thence, we put a sacke
of meale [out of our boat] into the boate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15057src" href="#xd33e15057" title="Go to note 998.">998</a> least we should chance to stray one from the other againe, that they might help themselues
therewith. And so about euening, when the sunne was west, we set saile and departed
from thence when it began to be high water, and with a north-east wind held our course
north-west along by the land.
</p>
<p>The 24 of August the wind blew east, and then, the sunne being east, we got to the
Seuen Islands,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15064src" href="#xd33e15064" title="Go to note 999.">999</a> where we found many fishermen, of whom we enquired after Cool and Kilduin, and they
made signes that they lay west from vs, (which we likewise gest to be so.) And withall
they shewed vs great frendship, and cast a cod into our scute, but for that we had
a good gale of wind<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15067src" href="#xd33e15067" title="Go to note 1000.">1000</a> we could not stay to pay them for it, but gaue them great thanks, much wondering
at their great courtesy. And so, with a good gale of wind, we arriued before the Seven
Islands when the sun was south-west, and past between them and the land, and there
found certaine fishermen, that rowed to vs,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15072src" href="#xd33e15072" title="Go to note 1001.">1001</a> and asked vs where our crable (meaning our ship) was, whereunto wee made answer with
as much Russian language as we had learned, and said, <i>Crable pro pal</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15078src" href="#xd33e15078" title="Go to note 1002.">1002</a> (y<sup>t</sup> is, our ship is lost), which they <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>vnderstanding said vnto vs, <i>Cool Brabouse crable</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15090src" href="#xd33e15090" title="Go to note 1003.">1003</a> whereby we vnderstood that at Cool there was certaine Neatherland ships, but we made
no great account thereof, because our intent was to saile to Ware-house,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15098src" href="#xd33e15098" title="Go to note 1004.">1004</a> fearing least the Russians or great prince of the country would stay vs there.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15103src" href="#xd33e15103" title="Go to note 1005.">1005</a>
</p>
<p>The 25 of August, sailing along by the land with a south-east wind, about the south
sun we had a sight of Kilduin, at which time we held our course west north-west. And
sailing in that manner between Kilduin and the firme land, about the south south-west
sunne we got to the west end of Kilduin. And being there [we] lookt [out sharp] if
we could see any houses or people therein, and at last we saw certaine Russian lodgies<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15110src" href="#xd33e15110" title="Go to note 1006.">1006</a> that lay [hauled up] upon the strand, and there finding a conuenient place for vs
to anchor with our scutes while we went to know if any people were to be found, our
maister put in with the land,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15113src" href="#xd33e15113" title="Go to note 1007.">1007</a> and there found five or six small houses, wherein the Laplanders dwelt, of whom he<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15118src" href="#xd33e15118" title="Go to note 1008.">1008</a> asked if that were Kilduin, whereunto they made answere and shewed vs that it was
Kilduin, and said y<sup>t</sup> at Coola there lay three Brabants crables or ships, whereof two were that day to
set saile; which we hearing determined to saile to Ware-house, and about the west
south-west sunne put off from thence with a south-east wind. But as we were vnder
saile, the wind blew <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>so stiffe [from the south-east] that we durst not keepe the sea in the night time,
for that the waues of the sea went so hollow, that we were still in doubt that they
would smite the scutes to the ground,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15128src" href="#xd33e15128" title="Go to note 1009.">1009</a> and so tooke our course behind two clifts<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15133src" href="#xd33e15133" title="Go to note 1010.">1010</a> towards our land. And when we came there, we found a small house vpon the shore,
wherein there was three men and a great dogge, which receiued vs very friendly, asking
vs of our affaires and how we got thither; whereunto we made answere and shewed them
that we had lost our ship, and that we were come thither to see if we could get a
ship that would bring vs into Holland; whereunto they made vs answere, as the other
Russians had done, that there was three ships at Coola, whereof two were to set saile
from thence that day. Then we asked them if they would goe with one of our men by
land to Coola, to looke for a ship wherewith we might get into Holland, and said we
would reward them well for their paines; but they excused themselues, and said that
they could not go from thence, but they sayd that they would bring vs ouer the hill,
where we should finde certaine Laplanders whom they thought would goe with vs, as
they did; for the maister and one of our men going with them ouer the hill, found
certaine Laplanders there, whereof they got one to go with our man, promising him
two royals of eight<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15138src" href="#xd33e15138" title="Go to note 1011.">1011</a> for his pains. And so the Laplander going with him, tooke a peece on his necke,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15147src" href="#xd33e15147" title="Go to note 1012.">1012</a> and our man a boate hooke, and about euening they set forward,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15152src" href="#xd33e15152" title="Go to note 1013.">1013</a> the wind as then being east and east north-east.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 26 of August it was faire weather, the wind south-east, at which time we drew
vp both our scutes vpon the land, and tooke all the goods out of them, to make them
the lighter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15162src" href="#xd33e15162" title="Go to note 1014.">1014</a> Which done, we went to the Russians and warmed vs, and there dressed such meates<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15169src" href="#xd33e15169" title="Go to note 1015.">1015</a> as we had; and then againe wee began to make two meales a day, when we perceiued
that we should euery day find more people, and we drank of their drink which they
call <i>quas</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15176src" href="#xd33e15176" title="Go to note 1016.">1016</a> which was made of broken peeces of [mouldy] bread, and it tasted well, for in long
time we had drunke nothing else but water. Some of our men went [somewhat] further
into the land, and there found blew berries and bramble berries,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15184src" href="#xd33e15184" title="Go to note 1017.">1017</a> which they plucked and eate, and they did us much good, for we found that they [perfectly]
healed vs of our loosenesse.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15197src" href="#xd33e15197" title="Go to note 1018.">1018</a> The wind still blew south-east.
</p>
<p>The 27 of August it was foule weather with a great storm [out of the] north and north
north-west, so that in regard that the strand was low,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15204src" href="#xd33e15204" title="Go to note 1019.">1019</a> and as also for that the spring tide was ready to come on, we drew our scutes a great
way vp vpon the land. [And when we had thus drawn them much higher up than we had
done before, on account of the high water<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15209src" href="#xd33e15209" title="Go to note 1020.">1020</a>], we went [still further upwards] to the Russians, to warme vs by their fire and
to dress our meate. Mean time the maister <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>sent one of our men to the sea side to our scutes, to make a fire for vs vpon the
strand, that when we came we might finde it ready, and that in the meane time the
smoake might be gone. And while [the] one of our men was there, and the other was
going thither,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15214src" href="#xd33e15214" title="Go to note 1021.">1021</a> the water draue <span class="corr" id="xd33e15219" title="Source: se">so</span> high that both our scutes were smitten into the water and in great danger to be cast
away; for in the scute there was but two men and three in the boate, who with much
labour and paine could hardly keep the scutes from being broken vpon the strand.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15223src" href="#xd33e15223" title="Go to note 1022.">1022</a> Which we seeing, were in great doubt,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15228src" href="#xd33e15228" title="Go to note 1023.">1023</a> and yet could not help them, yet God be thanked he had then brought vs so farre that
neuerthelesse we could haue gotten home, although we should have lost our scutes,
as after it was seene. That day and all night it rained sore, whereby we indured great
trouble and miserie, being throughly wet, and could neither couer nor defend our selues
from it; and yet they [who were] in the scutes indured much more, being forced to
bee in that weather, and still in daunger to bee cast vpon the shore.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15233src" href="#xd33e15233" title="Go to note 1024.">1024</a>
</p>
<p>The 28 of August it was indifferent good weather, and then we drew the scutes vpon
the land againe, that we might take the rest of the goods out of them, [in order to
avoid the like danger in which the boats had been,] because the wind still blew hard
north and north north-west. And hauing drawne the scutes vp, we spread our sailes
vpon them to shelter vs vnder them, for it was still mistie and rainie weather, much
desiring to heare some newes of our man that was gone to Coola with the Lapelander,
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>know if there were any shipping at Coola to bring vs into Holland. And while we laie
there we went [daily] into the land and fetcht some blew berries and bramble berries<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15242src" href="#xd33e15242" title="Go to note 1025.">1025</a> to eate, which did vs much good.
</p>
<p>The 29 of <span class="corr" id="xd33e15247" title="Source: Angust">August</span> it was indifferent faire weather, and we were still in good hope<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15250src" href="#xd33e15250" title="Go to note 1026.">1026</a> to heare some good newes from Coola, and alwaies looked vp towards the hill to see
if our man and the Lapelander came; but seeing they came not<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15255src" href="#xd33e15255" title="Go to note 1027.">1027</a> we went to the Russians againe, and there drest our meate [at their fire], and then
ment<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15260src" href="#xd33e15260" title="Go to note 1028.">1028</a> to goe to our scutes to lodge in them all night. In the meane time we spied the Laplander
[upon the hill] comming alone without our man, whereat we wondred and were some what
in doubt;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15263src" href="#xd33e15263" title="Go to note 1029.">1029</a> but when he came vnto vs, he shewed vs a letter that was written vnto our maister,
which he opened before vs, the contents thereof being that he that had written the
letter wondred much at our arriuall in that place, and that long since he verily thought
that we had beene all cast away,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15269src" href="#xd33e15269" title="Go to note 1030.">1030</a> being exceeding glad of our happy fortune,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15274src" href="#xd33e15274" title="Go to note 1031.">1031</a> and how that he would presently come vnto vs with victuales and all other necessaries
to succour vs withall. We being in no small admiration who it might be that shewed
vs so great fauour and friendship, could not imagine what he was, for it appeared
by the letter that he knew vs well. And although the letter was subscribed “by me
John Cornelison Rip,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15279src" href="#xd33e15279" title="Go to note 1032.">1032</a> yet we could not be perswaded that it was the same John Cornelison, who the yeere
before had beene set out in the other ship [at the same <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>time] with vs, and left vs about the Beare Iland.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15286src" href="#xd33e15286" title="Go to note 1033.">1033</a> For those goode newes we paid the Lapelander his hier,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15289src" href="#xd33e15289" title="Go to note 1034.">1034</a> and beside that gaue him hoase, breeches and other furniture,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15297src" href="#xd33e15297" title="Go to note 1035.">1035</a> so that he was apparelled like a Hollander; for as then we thought our selues to
be wholy out of danger,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15300src" href="#xd33e15300" title="Go to note 1036.">1036</a> and so being of good comfort, we laid vs downe to rest. Here I cannot chuse but shew
you how fast the Lapelander went: for when hee went to Coola, as our companion told
vs, they were two dayes and two nights on the way, and yet went a pace, and when he
came backe againe he was but a day and a night comming to vs, which was wonderful,
it being but halfe y<sup>e</sup> time, so that we said, and verily thought, that he was halfe a coniurer;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15308src" href="#xd33e15308" title="Go to note 1037.">1037</a> and he brought vs a partridge, which he had killed by the way as he went.
</p>
<p>The 30 of August it was indifferent faire weather, we still wondering who that John
Cornelison might be that had written vnto vs; and while we sat musing thereon, some
of vs were of opinion that it might be the same John Cornelison that had sayled out
of Holland in company with vs, which we could not be perswaded to beleeue, because
we were in as little hope of his life as hee of ours, supposing that he had sped worse
then we, and long before that had [perished or] beene caste away. At last the master
said, I will looke amongst my letters, for there I haue his name written,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15315src" href="#xd33e15315" title="Go to note 1038.">1038</a> and that will put us out of doubt. And so, looking amongst them, we found that it
was the same John Cornelison, wherewith we were as glad of his safety and welfare
as he was of ours. And while we were speaking thereof, and that some <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>of vs would not beleeue that it was the same John Cornelison, we saw a Russian joll<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15322src" href="#xd33e15322" title="Go to note 1039.">1039</a> come rowing, with John Cornelison and our companion that we had sent to Coola; who
being landed, we receiued and welcomed each other w<sup>t</sup> great joy and exceeding gladnesse, as if either of vs on both sides had seene each
other rise from death to life again; for we esteemed him, and he vs, to be dead long
since. He brought vs a barrell of Roswicke beere,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15330src" href="#xd33e15330" title="Go to note 1040.">1040</a> wine, aqua uite,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15336src" href="#xd33e15336" title="Go to note 1041.">1041</a> bread, flesh, bacon, salmon, suger, and other things, which comforted and releeued
vs much. And wee rejoyced together for our so vnexpected [safety and] meeting, at
that time giuing God great thankes for his mercy shewed vnto vs.
</p>
<p>The 31 of August it was indifferent faire weather, the wind easterly, but in the evening
it began to blow hard from the land; and then we made preparation to saile from thence
to Coola, first taking our leaues of the Russians, and heartily thanking them for
their curtesie showed vnto vs, and gaue them a peece of money<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15344src" href="#xd33e15344" title="Go to note 1042.">1042</a> for their good wils, and at night about the north sunne we sailed from thence with
a high water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15349src" href="#xd33e15349" title="Go to note 1043.">1043</a>
</p>
<p>The 1 of September in the morning, with the east sunne, we got to y<sup>e</sup> west side of the river of Coola,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15359src" href="#xd33e15359" title="Go to note 1044.">1044</a> and entered into it, where we [sailed and] rowed till the flood was past, and then
we cast the stones that serued vs for anchors vpon the ground, at a point of land,
till the flood came in againe. And when the sunne was south, wee set saile againe
with the flood, and so sailed and rowed till midnight, and then we cast anchor againe
till morning.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>The 2 of September in the morning we rowed vp the riuer, and as we past along we saw
some trees on the riuer side, which comforted vs and made vs as glad as if we had
then come into a new world, for in all the time y<sup>t</sup> we had beene out we had not seene any trees; and when we were by the salt kettles,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15370src" href="#xd33e15370" title="Go to note 1045.">1045</a> which is about three [12] miles from Coola, we stayed there awhile and made merry,
and then went forward againe, and with the west north-west sun got to John Cornelisons
ship, wherein we entred and drunke.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15377src" href="#xd33e15377" title="Go to note 1046.">1046</a> There wee began to make merry againe with the sailers that were therein and that
had beene in the voiage with John Cornelison the yeare before and bad each other welcome.
Then we rowed forward, and late in the euening got to Coola, where some of vs went
on land, and some stayed in the scutes to looke to the goods, to whom we sent milke
and other things to comfort and refresh them; and we were all exceeding glad that
God of his mercy had deliuered vs out of so many dangers and troubles, and had brought
vs thither in safety: for as then wee esteemed our selues to be safe, although <span class="corr" id="xd33e15382" title="Source: ye">y<sup>e</sup></span> place in times past, lying so far from vs, was as much vnknowne vnto vs as if it
had beene out of the world, and at that time, being there, we thought y<sup>t</sup> we were almost at home.
</p>
<p>The 3 of September we vnladed all our goods, and there refreshed our selues after
our toylesome and weary iourney and the great hunger that we had indured, thereby
to recouer our healthes and strengthes againe.
</p>
<p>The 11 of September,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15398src" href="#xd33e15398" title="Go to note 1047.">1047</a> by leaue and consent of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>bayart,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15409src" href="#xd33e15409" title="Go to note 1048.">1048</a> gouernour for the Great Prince of Muscouia, we brought our scute and our boate into
the merchants house,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15414src" href="#xd33e15414" title="Go to note 1049.">1049</a> and there let them stand<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15424src" href="#xd33e15424" title="Go to note 1050.">1050</a> for a remembrance of our long, farre, and neuer before sailed way, and that we had
sailed in those open scutes almost 400 Dutch [1600] miles, through and along by the
sea coasts to the towne of Coola, whereat the inhabitants thereof could not sufficiently
wonder.
</p>
<p>The 15 of Sep[tember] we went into a lodgie [and sailed down the river] w<sup>t</sup> all our goods and our men to John Cornelisons ship, which lay about half a mile [2
miles] from the towne, and that day [at noon] sailed in the ship [further] downe the
riuer til we were beyond the narrowest part therof, which was about half the riuer,
and there staied for John Cornelison and our maister, that said they would come to
vs the next day.
</p>
<p>The 17 of September [in the evening] John Cornelison and our maister being come abord,
the next day about the east sunne we set saile out of the riuer [of] Coola, and with
Gods grace put to sea to saile hom-wards; and being out of the riuer we sailed along
by the land north-west and by north, the wind being south.
</p>
<p>The 19 of September, about the south sunne, we got to Ware-house, and there ankored
and went on land, because John Cornelison was there to take in more goods, and staid
there til the sixt of October, in the which time we had a<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15437src" href="#xd33e15437" title="Go to note 1051.">1051</a> hard wind out of the north and north-west. And while we stayed there we refreshed
our selues somewhat better, to recouer [from] our sicknesse and weaknesse againe,
that we <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>might grow stronger, which asked sometime,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15444src" href="#xd33e15444" title="Go to note 1052.">1052</a> for we were much spent and exceeding weake.
</p>
<p>The 6 of October, about euening, the sunne being south-west, we set saile, and with
Gods grace, from Ware-house for Holland; but for that it is a common and well knowne
way, I will speak nothing thereof, only that vpon the 29 October we ariued in the
Mase<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15451src" href="#xd33e15451" title="Go to note 1053.">1053</a> with an east north-east wind, and the next morning got to Maseland sluce,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15456src" href="#xd33e15456" title="Go to note 1054.">1054</a> and there going on land, from thence rowed to Delfe, and then to the Hage, and from
thence to Harlem;<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15461src" href="#xd33e15461" title="Go to note 1055.">1055</a> and vpon the first of Nouember about noone got to Amsterdam, in the same clothes
that we ware in Noua Zembla, with our caps furd with white foxes skins,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15466src" href="#xd33e15466" title="Go to note 1056.">1056</a> and went to the house of Peter Hasselaer, that was one of the marchants that set
out the two ships,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15471src" href="#xd33e15471" title="Go to note 1057.">1057</a> which were conducted by John Cornelison and our maister. And being there, where many
men woundred to see vs, as hauing estemed vs long before that to haue bin dead and
rotten, the newes thereof being spread abroad in the towne, it was also caried to
the Princes Courte in the Hage,<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15477src" href="#xd33e15477" title="Go to note 1058.">1058</a> at which time the Lord Chancelor of Denmark, ambassador for the said king, was then

<p class="footnote cont">For the reason which will appear in the sequel, it is deemed advisable to reproduce
here the elaborate description of “the goose tree, barnacle tree, or the tree bearing
geese”, given by the learned John Gerard, in his <i>Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes</i>, of which the first edition was published in 1597:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“There are found in the north parts of Scotland and the islands adiacent, called Orchades,
certain trees, whereon do grow certaine shells of a white colour tending to russet,
wherein are contained little liuing creatures: which shells in time of maturitie do
open, and out of them grow those little liuing things, which falling into the water
do become fowles, which we call barnakles; in the north of England, brant geese; and
in Lancashire, tree geese: but the other that do fall vpon the land perish and come
to nothing. Thus much by the writings of others, and also from the mouths of people
of those parts, which may very well accord with truth.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“But what our eyes haue seene, and hands haue touched, we shall <span class="pageNum" id="pb81n">[<a href="#pb81n">81</a>]</span>declare. There is a small island in Lancashire called the Pile of Foulders, wherein
are found the broken pieces of old and bruised ships, some whereof haue been cast
thither by shipwracke, and also the trunks and bodies with the branches of old and
rotten trees, cast vp there likewise; whereon is found a certaine spume or froth that
in time breedeth vnto certaine shels, in shape like those of the muskle, but sharper
pointed, and of a whitish colour; wherein is contained a thing in forme like a lace
of silke finely wouen as it were together, of a whitish colour, one end whereof is
fastned vnto the inside of the shell, euen as the fish of oisters and muskles are;
the other end is made fast vnto the belly of a rude masse or lumpe, which in time
commeth to the shape and forme of a bird: when it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth
open, and the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string; next come
the legs of the bird hanging out, and as it groweth greater it openeth the shell by
degrees, til at length it is all come forth, and hangeth onely by the bill; in short
space after it commeth to full maturitie, and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth
feathers, and groweth to a fowle bigger than a mallard, and lesser than a goose, hauing
blacke legs and bill or beake, and feathers blacke and white, spotted in such manner
as is our mag-pie, called in some places a pie-annet, which the people of Lancashire
call by no other name than a tree-goose: which place aforesaid, and all those parts
adioyning, do so much abound therewith, that one of the best is bought for three pence.
For the truth hereof, if any doubt, may it please them to repaire vnto me, and I shall
satisfie them by the testimonie of good witnesses.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“Moreouer, it should seeme that there is another sort hereof; the historie of which
is true, and of mine owne knowledge: for trauelling vpon the shore of our English
coast betweene Douer and Rumney, I found the trunke of an old rotten tree, which (with
some helpe that I procured by fishermens wiues that were there attending their husbands
returne from the sea) we drew out of the water vpon dry land: vpon this rotten tree
I found growing many thousands of long crimson bladders, in shape like vnto puddings
newly filled, before they be sodden, which were <span class="pageNum" id="pb82n">[<a href="#pb82n">82</a>]</span>very cleere and shining; at the nether end whereof did grow a shell fish, fashioned
somewhat like a small muskle, but much whiter, resembling a shell fish that groweth
vpon the rocks about Garnsey and Garsey, called a lympit: many of these shells I brought
with me to London, which after I had opened I found in them liuing things without
forme or shape; in others which were neerer come to ripenes I found liuing things
that were very naked, in shape like a bird: in others, the birds couered with soft
downe, the shell halfe open, and the bird ready to fall out, which no doubt were the
fowles called barnakles. I dare not absolutely auouch euery circumstance of the first
part of this history, concerning the tree that beareth those buds aforesaid, but will
leaue it to a further consideration; howbeit that which I haue seene with mine eyes,
and handled with mine hands, I dare confidently auouch, and boldly put downe for veritie.
Now if any will obiect, that this tree which I saw might be one of those before mentioned,
which either by the waues of the sea or some violent wind had been ouerturned, as
many other trees are; or that any trees falling into those seas about the Orchades,
will of themselves beare the like fowles, by reason of those seas and waters, these
being so probable coniectures, and likely to be true, I may not without preiudice
gainesay, or indeauor to confute.”—(2nd edit.) p. 1588.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Difficult as it is to understand how a man of Gerard’s genius and information could
have been thus deceived, the perfect sincerity of his belief is not to be doubted.
Seeing, then, how deep rooted this popular error must have been, it was no small merit
of William Barentz and his companions that they should have been mainly instrumental
in disabusing the public mind on the subject. That they were so, and that at the time
they enjoyed the credit of being so, is manifest from the following note on the foregoing
passage, made by Thomas Johnson, the editor of the second edition of the <i>Herball</i>, published in 1633:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“The barnakles, whose fabulous breed my author here sets downe, and diuers others
haue also deliuered, were found by some Hollanders to haue another originall, and
that by egges, as other birds haue: for they in their third voyage to find out the
north-east passage to China and the Molucco’s, about the eightieth degree and eleuen
minutes of northerly latitude, found two little islands, in the one of which they
found aboundance of these geese sitting vpon their egges, of which they got one goose,
and tooke away sixty egges, etc. <i lang="la">Vide Pontani, Rerum et vrb. Amstelodam. Hist., lib. 2, cap. 22.</i>”
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Parkinson, too, in his <i lang="la">Theatrum Botanicum</i>, published in 1640 (p. 1306), gives our Dutch navigators full credit for having confuted
“this admirable tale of untruth”.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e7177src" title="Return to note 59 in text.">↑</a></p>

In one of the printed accounts of the riots of 1780 (the reference to which cannot
just now be found), it is mentioned that a <i>pig’s-foot</i>—the “jemmy” little tool used by housebreakers—was employed in the destruction of
Newgate, and surprise was expressed at the power of so small an instrument to move
the large stones of which that building was constructed. The small iron hammer common
in our printing-offices is likewise called a <i>sheep’s-foot</i>; the reason for the name being in each case the same.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e7990src" title="Return to note 154 in text.">↑</a></p>

of which are used for ornamenting the houses and churches in the month of May.

<p class="footnote cont">The same name is given to the green branch of a tree, or at times the whole tree itself—frequently
the birch, but not exclusively so—which is set up on occasions of festivity. This
is the <i>meyboom</i> of the Dutch; and it would seem on the one hand to be the original of our English

This is the person who on a former occasion (page 121) was called <i lang="nl">de surgijn</i>—the surgeon. In the general decline of science during the middle ages, surgery, as
a branch of medicine, became neglected, and its practice, in the rudest form, fell
into the hands of the barber; from whose ordinary avocations of cutting the hair,
shaving the beard, paring the nails, etc., the step was not very great to the operations
of tooth-drawing, bleeding, cupping, dressing wounds, setting broken limbs, etc. And,
with these functions of the surgeon, the barber not unreasonably assumed his title
also.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The rivalry between these barber-surgeons and the pure surgeons, who again sprang
up on the revival of learning, is matter of history.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In England, a compromise between the two rival bodies was early effected by means
of the union of the barber-surgeons and surgeons of London, by the statute of 32 Hen.
VIII, c. 41 (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1540), which, while nominally amalgamating them, virtually effected the separation
of the two professions; inasmuch as those members of the united corporation “using
barbery”—as it was somewhat barbarously expressed—were prohibited from “occupying
any surgery, letting of blood, or any other thing belonging to surgery, drawing of
teeth only except”; while, on the other hand, surgeons were forbidden to “use barbery”.
And the natural consequence was their formal separation into two entirely distinct
bodies by the Act of 18 Geo. II, c. 15 (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 1745).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">On the continent, the barber-surgeon retained his rank to a much later date; and in
France, in particular, till the revolution of 1793. <span class="pageNum" id="pb126n">[<a href="#pb126n">126</a>]</span>But, instead of abandoning the razor to the hair-dresser, he still claimed the right
of wielding it, “as being a <i>surgical</i> instrument”; so that, in order to distinguish between the two, it was ordained by
Louis XIV, that the barber-surgeon should have for his sign a brass basin, and should
paint his shop-front red or black only, whereas the barber-hairdresser should display
a pewter basin, and paint his shop-front in any other colour. Blue was the colour
usually adopted by the barber-hairdressers, and to this colour their name has in consequence
become attached. That the connexion between the two is still not lost sight of in
France, is proved by the following extract from the <i lang="fr">Comédies et Proverbes</i> of Alfred de Musset, p. 510:—

therefore a great mistake in using either of these two colours. “True like the needle
to the pole,” as Lieutenant Taffril wrote to Jenny Caxon (“To cast up to her that
her father’s a barber and has a pole at his door, and that she’s but a manty-maker
hersel! Fy for shame!”), they should confine themselves to the colour of constancy—and
of the hairdressers; unless, indeed, they should happen to unite tooth-drawing to
their other avocations, in which case they might perhaps, in strict right, be entitled
to set up the red or black stripe of the barber-surgeons.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e9071src" title="Return to note 296 in text.">↑</a></p>

six o’clock in the morning. For at the time of the conjunction, the sun was more than
20° below the horizon; and as the dawn is not perceptible till the sun is about 18°
from the horizon, they could not have possessed even this imperfect means of observing
its general bearing, without the aid of the anomalous refraction.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e10072src" title="Return to note 409 in text.">↑</a></p>

latitude of the place of observation was to the north of 76°.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">It is quite true that, as the sun’s lower edge was observed, its semi-diameter has
to be added. But the effect of this is to increase, not the height of the Pole, but
its complement; which, adopting the observer’s own figures, would be 14° 16′ + 16′
= 14° 32′, so that the height of the Pole would be only 75° 28′. There is, however,
another correction to be made, namely, for refraction, of which at that early period
no account was taken; and this being as much as 15′,<sub>1</sub>, the discrepancy is thereby so much reduced. The correct calculation of the observation
will therefore be as follows:—

found the sun’s altitude to be 14°, believing it to be then on the equinoctial, and
therefore without declination. But at mean noon in Novaya Zemlya, the sun’s declination
on March 20th was—0° 8′,<sub>8</sub>, and on March 21st + 0° 14′,<sub>9</sub>, the sun having crossed the equinoctial between 10 and 11 o’clock of the intervening

we have 75° 49′,<sub>5</sub>. In either case the latitude will be rather to the <i>south</i> than to the north of the 76th parallel. But, as all the latter observations of the
sun were made under an erroneous impression, and evidently with a desire that they
should correspond with what was believed to be the truth, the safest plan will be
to content ourselves with the observations of the two stars and the first observation
of the sun on February 19th, the result of which will be:—

he takes on himself to paraphrase the term by “our pilot”. But the statement on the
20th June (page 198), that the chief-boatswain came on board the boat in which William
Barentsz. was, just before the latter’s death, clearly proves that two different persons
are here intended: so that, in order to avoid ambiguity, a conjunction, or at least
a comma, should be inserted between the two. From the list of the ship’s company given
in page 193, it may be safely inferred that the “chief-boatswain”, or first mate,
as we should now call him, was Pieter Pieterszoon Vos. It is he, most probably, who
on the 28th August, 1596 (page 100) is called “the other pilot”.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd33e12479src" title="Return to note 629 in text.">↑</a></p>

title of “meester”, representing the Latin <i>magister</i>, shows that he was a member of a learned profession, who had not improbably taken
his degree of “Magister Artium Liberalium”, at an university. In Hungary, at the present
day,—as we learn from the evidence of C.&nbsp;A. Noedl, on the recent trial of C. Derra
de Meroda against Dawson and others, in the notorious affair of the Baroness von Beck,—“if
a man wishes to become <i>a surgeon</i>, he must attend six Latin schools [meaning, apparently, that he must keep six terms
at the High School or University], <i>and learn to cut hair</i>”.—<i>Morning Post</i>, July 29th, 1852.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In the journal of Captain James, printed in Mr. Rundall’s <i>Narrative of Voyages towards the North-West</i> (page 199), is the following entry, under the date of November 30th, 1631:—“Betimes,
in the morning, I caused the chirurgion to cut off my hair short, and to shave away
all the hair of my face.… The like did all the rest.” This was at a period when, as
appears from the muster-roll of Captain Waymouth’s expedition, given in page 238 of

<h3 class="main">AN ACCOUNT OF HENRY HUDSON’S VISIT TO NOVAYA ZEMLYA.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Extracted from “A Second Voyage or Employment of Master Henry Hudson, for finding
a Passage to the East Indies by the North-East: written by himselfe.” Printed in Purchas
his Pilgrimes, vol. iii, pp. 577–579.
</p>
<p>[<i>June</i>, 1608.] The sixe and twentieth, faire sun-shining weather, and little wind at east
north-east. From twelue a clocke at night till foure this morning we stood southward
two leagues, sounding wee had sixtie sixe fathome oaze, as afore. From four a clocke
to noone, south-east and by south foure leagues, and had the sunne on the meridian
on the south-east and by south point of the compasse, in the latitude of 72 degrees
25 minutes, and had sight of Noua Zembla foure or five leagues from vs, and the place
called by the Hollanders Swart Cliffe bearing off south-east. In the after-noone wee
had a fine gale at east north-east, and by eight of the clocke we had brought it to
beare off vs east southerly, and sayled by the shoare a league from it.
</p>
<p>The seuen and twentieth, all the fore-noone it was almost calme. Wee being two mile
from the shoare, I sent my mate Robert Iuet and Iohn Cooke my boat-swaine on shoare,
with foure others, to see what the land would yeeld that might bee profitable, and
to fill two or three caskes with water. They found and brought aboord some whales
finnes, two deeres hornes, and the dung of deere, and they told me that they saw grasse
on the shoare of the last yeere, and young grasse came up amongst it a shaftman long,
and it was boggie ground in some places; there are many streames of <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>snow water nigh, it was very hot on the shoare, and the snow melted apace; they saw
the footings of many great beares, of deere, and foxes. They went from vs at three
a clocke in the morning, and came aboord at a south-east sunne; and at their comming
we saw two or three companies of morses in the sea neere vs swimming, being almost
calme. I presently sent my mate, Ladlow the carpenter, and sixe others ashoare, to
a place where I thought the morses might come on the shoare; they found the place
likely, but found no signe of any that had beene there. There was a crosse standing
on the shoare, much driftwood, and signes of fires that had beene made there. They
saw the footing of very great deere and bears, and much fowle, and a foxe; they brought
aboord whale finnes, some mosse, flowers, and greene things, that did there grow.
They brought also two peeces of a crosse, which they found there. The sunne was on
the meridian on the north north-east, halfe a point easterly, before it began to fall.
The sunnes height was 4 degrees 45 minutes, inclination 22 degrees 33 minutes, which
makes the latitude 72 degrees 12 minutes. There is disagreement betweene this and
the last obseruation; but by meanes of the cleerenesse of the sunne, the smoothnesse
of the sea, and the neerness to land, wee could not bee deceiued, and care was taken
in it.
</p>
<p>The eight and twentieth, at foure a clocke in the morning, our boat came aboord, and
brought two dozen of fowle, and some egges, whereof a few were good, and a whales
finne; and wee all saw the sea full of morses, yet no signes of their being on shoare.
And in this calme, from eight a clocke last eeuening till foure this morning, wee
were drawne backe to the northward as farre as wee were the last eeuening at foure
a clocke by a streame or a tide; and wee choose rather so to driue, then to aduenture
the losse of an anchor and the spoyle of a cable. Heere our new ship-boate began to
doe vs seruice, and was an incouragement to my companie, which want I found the last
yeere.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>The nine and twentieth, in the morning calme, being halfe a league from the shoare,
the sea being smooth, the needle did encline 84 degrees; we had many morses in the
sea neere vs, and desiring to find where they came on shoare, wee put to with sayle
and oares, towing in our boat and rowing in our barke, to get about a point of land,
from whence the land did fall more easterly, and the morses did goe that way. Wee
had the sunne on the meridian on the south and by west point, halfe a point to the
wester part of the compasse, in the latitude of 71 degrees 15 minutes. At two a clocke
this after-noone we came to anchor in the mouth of a riuer, where lieth an iland in
the mouth thereof foure leagues: wee anchored from the iland in two and thirtie fathomes
blacke sandy ground. There droue much ice out of it with a streame that set out of
the river or sound, and there were many morses sleeping on the ice, and by it we were
put from our road twice this night; and being calme on this day, it pleased God at
our neede to giue vs a fine gale, which freed vs out of danger. This day was calme,
cleere and hot weather: all the night we rode still.
</p>
<p>The thirtieth, calme, hot, and faire weather: we weighed in the morning, and towed
and rowed, and at noone we came to anchor neere the ile aforesaid in the mouth of
the riuer, and saw very much ice driuing in the sea, two leagues without vs, lying
south-east and north-west, and driving to the north-west so fast, that wee could not
by twelve a clocke at night see it out of the top. At the iland where wee rode lieth
a little rocke, whereon were fortie or fiftie morses lying asleepe, being all that
it could hold, it being so full and little. I sent my companie ashoare to them, leauing
none aboord but my boy with mee; and by meanes of their neerenesse to the water they
all got away, saue one which they killed, and brought his head aboord; and ere they
came aboord they went on the iland, which is reasonable high and steepe, but flat
on the top. They killed and brought with <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>them a great fowle, whereof there were many, and likewise some egges, and in an houre
they came aboord. The ile is two flight-shot ouer in length, and one in breadth. At
midnight our anchor came home, and wee tayld aground by meanes of the strength of
the streame; but by the helpe of God wee houed her off without hurt. In short time
wee moued our ship, and rode still all night; and in the night wee had little wind
at east and east south-east. Wee had at noone this day an obseruation, and were in
the latitude of 71 degrees 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>The first of July wee saw more ice to seaward of vs, from the south-east to the north-west,
driuing to the north-west. At noone it was calme, and we had the sunne on the meridian
on the south and by west point, halfe a point to the westerly part of the compasse,
in the latitude of 71 degrees 24 minutes. This morning I sent my mate Eueret and foure
of our companie, to rowe about the bay, to see what riuers were in the same, and to
find where the morses did come on land, and to see a sound or great riuer in the bottome
of the bay, which did alwaies send out a great streame to the north-wards, against
the tide that came from thence: and I found the same, in comming in from the north
to this place, before this. When, by the meanes of the great plenty of ice, the hope
of passage betweene Newland and Noua Zembla was taken away, my purpose was by the
Vaygats to passe by the mouth of the river Ob, and to double that way the north cape
of Tartaria, or to giue reason wherefore it will not be: but being here, and hoping
by the plentie of morses wee saw here to defray the charge of our voyage; and also
that this sound might for some reasons bee a better passage to the east of Noua Zembla
than the Vaygats, if it held according to my hope conceiued by the likenesse it gaue:
for whereas we had a floud came from the northwards, yet this sound or riuer did runne
so strong, that ice with the streame of this riuer was carried away, or anything else,
against the <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>floud: so that both in floud and ebbe, the streame doth hold a strong course, and
it floweth from the north three houres, and ebbeth nine.
</p>
<p>The second, the wind being at east south-east, it was reasonable cold and so was Friday;
and the morses did not play in our sight as in warme weather. This morning at three
of the clocke, my mate and companie came aboord, and brought a great deeres horne,
a white locke of deeres haire, foure dozen of fowle, their boat halfe laden with drift
wood, and some flowers and greene things, that they found growing on the shoare. They
saw a herd of white deere of ten in a companie on the land, much drift wood lying
on the shoare, many good bayes, and one riuer faire to see to, on the north shoare,
for the morses to land on; but they saw no morses there, but signes that they had
beene in the bayes. And the great riuer or sound, they certified me, was of breadth
two or three leagues, and had no ground at twentie fathoms and that the water was
of the colour of the sea, and very salt, and that the stream setteth strongly out
of it. At sixe a clocke this morning, came much ice from the south-ward driuing upon
us, very fearefull to looke on; but by the mercy of God and his mightie helpe, wee
being moored with two anchors ahead, with vering out of one cable and heauing home
the other, and fending off with beams and sparres, escaped the danger: which labour
continued till sixe a clocke in the euening, and then it was past vs, and we rode
still and tooke our rest this night.
</p>
<p>The third, the wind at north a hard gale. At three a clocke this morning wee weighed
our anchor, and set sayle, purposing to runne into the riuer or sound before spoken
of.
</p>
<p>The fourth, in the morning, it cleered up with the wind at north-west; we weighed
and set sayle, and stood to the eastwards, and passed ouer a reefe and found on it
fiue and a halfe, sixe, sixe and a halfe and seuen fathoms water: then wee saw that
the sound was full and a very large riuer <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>from the north-eastward free from ice, and a strong streame comming out of it; and
we had sounding then, foure and thirtie fathoms water. Wee all conceiued hope of this
northerly riuer or sound; and sayling in it, wee found three and twentie fathomes
for three leagues, and after twentie fathomes for fiue or sixe leagues, all tough
ozie ground. Then the winde vered more northerly, and the streame came downe so strong,
that we could doe no good on it; we come to anchor, and went to supper, and then presently
I sent my mate Iuet, with fiue more of our companie, in our boat with sayle and oares,
to get up the riuer, being prouided with victuals and weapons for defence, willing
them to sound as they went, and if it did continue still deepe, to go untill it did
trende to the eastward or to the southwards; and wee rode still.
</p>
<p>The fift, in the morning, we had the wind at west: we began to weigh anchor, purposing
to set sayle, and to runne vp the sound after our companie: then the wind vered northerly
upon vs, and we saued our labour. At noone our companie came aboord vs, having had
a hard rought; for they had beene vp the river sixe or seven leagues, and sounded
it from twentie to three and twentie, and after brought it to eight, sixe, and one
fathome, and then to foure foot in the best: they then went ashoare, and found good
store of wilde goose quills, a piece of an old oare, and some flowers, and green things
which they found growing: they saw many deere, and so did we in our after-dayes sayling.
They being come aboord, we presently set sayle with the wind at north north-west,
and we stood out againe to the south-westwards, with sorrow that our labour was in
vaine: for, had this sound held as it did make shew of, for breadth, depth, safenesse
of harbour, and good anchor ground, it might haue yeelded an excellent passage to
a more easterly sea. Generally, all the land of Noua Zembla that yet wee haue seene,
is to a mans eye a pleasant land; much mayne <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>high land with no snow on it, looking in some places greene, and deere feeding thereon;
and the hills are partly covered with snow, and partly bare. It is no maruell that
there is so much ice in the sea towards the Pole, so many sounds and riuers being
in the lands of Noua Zembla and Newland to ingender it; besides the coasts of Pechora,
Russia, and Groenland, with Lappia, as by proofes I finde by my trauell in these parts:
by means of which ice I suppose there will be no nauigable passage this way. This
eeuening wee had the wind at west and by south: wee therefore came to anchor under
Deere Point; and it was a storme at sea, wee rode in twentie fathomes, ozie ground:
I sent my mate Ladlow, with foure more ashore, to see whether any morses were on the
shoare, and to kill some fowle (for we had seene no morses since Saturday, the second
day of this moneth, that wee saw them driuing out of the ice). They found good landing
for them, but no signe that they had been there: but they found that fire had beene
made there, yet not lately. At ten of the clocke in the eeuening they came aboord,
and brought with them neere an hundred fowles called wellocks; this night it was wet
fogge, and very thicke and cold, the winde at west south-west.
</p>
<p>The sixt, in the morning, wee had the wind stormie and shifting, betweene the west
and south-west, against us for doing any good: we rode still, and had much ice driuing
by vs to the eastwards of vs. At nine of the clocke, this eeuening wee had the wind
at north north-west: we presently weighed, and set sayle, and stood to the westward,
being out of hope to find passage by the north-east: and my purpose was now to see
whether Willoughbies Land were, as it is layd in our cardes; which if it were, wee
might finde morses on it; for with the ice they were all driven from hence. This place
vpon Noua Zembla, is another then that which the Hollanders call Costing Sarch, discouered
by Oliuer Brownell: and William Barentsons obseruation doth witnesse <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>the same. It is layd in plot by the Hollanders out of his true place too farre north:
to what end I know not, unlesse to make it hold course with the compasse, not respecting
the variation. It is as broad and like to yeeld passage as the Vaygats, and my hope
was, that by the strong streame it would haue cleered it selfe; but it did not. It
is so full of ice that you will hardly thinke it.

<p class="first">[<i>Purchas his Pilgrimes</i>, vol. iii, pp. 518–520.]
</p>
<p>I thought good to adde hither for Barents or Barentsons sake, certaine notes which
I have found (the one translated, the other written by him (amongst Master Hakluyts
Paper).
</p>
<p class="xd33e130">This was written by William Barentson in a loose paper,<br>
which was lent mee by the Reuerend Peter Plantius in<br>
Amsterdam, March the seuen and twentieth, 1609.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15691src" href="#xd33e15691" title="Go to note 2.">2</a>
</p>
<p>The foure and twentieth of August, <i lang="la">stilo nouo</i>, 1595, wee spake with the Samoieds, and asked them how the land and sea did lye to
the east of Way-gates. They sayd, after fiue dayes iourney going north-east, wee should
come to a great sea, going south-east. This sea to the east of Way-gats they sayd
was called <i>Marmoria</i>, that is to say, <i>a calme sea</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd33e15703src" href="#xd33e15703" title="Go to note 3.">3</a> And they of Ward-house haue told vs the same. I asked them if at any time of the
yeere it was frozen ouer? They sayd it was. And that sometimes they passed it with
sleds. And the first of September 1595, <i lang="la">stilo nouo</i>, the Russes of the lodie or barke affirmed the same; saying, that the sea is sometimes
so frozen, that the lodies or barkes going sometimes to Gielhsidi from Pechora, are
forced there to winter; <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>which Gielhsidi was wonne from the Tartars three yeeres past.
</p>
<p>For the ebbe and flood there, I can finde none; but with the winde so runneth the
streame. The third of September, <i lang="la">stilo nouo</i>, the winde was south-west, and then I found the water higher then with the winde
at north north-east. Mine opinion is grounded on experience: that if there bee a passage,
it is small, or else the sea could not rise with a southerly winde. And for the better
proofe to know if there were a flood and ebbe, the ninth of September, <i lang="la">stilo nouo</i>, I went on shoare on the south end of the States Iland, where the crosse standeth,
and layd a stone on the brinke of the water to proue whether there were a tide, and
went round about the iland to shoote at a hare; and returning, I found the stone as
I left it, and the water neither higher nor lowere: which prooueth, as afore, that
there is no flood nor ebbe.
