<HTML><BODY><p>This book was published by the Hakluyt Society, which specialises in republishing the journals of old voyages.

<p>In their attempts to break the Spanish monopoly on trading with the east, the Dutch tried to find alternative routes to India and China in the late 16th century. This journal (translated from the Dutch) describes three of the more daring attempts to find a North-Easterly route, of which the last one ended with an involuntary over-winter stay in Nova Zembla, which made Willem Barentsz. famous in Holland to this day.

<p>This book appeared shortly after the remains of the expedition's house where found in 1871, and contains a lengthy introduction.

<p>Some old spellings and Dutch words, numerous footnotes, sidenotes, etc., but nothing insurmountable.
